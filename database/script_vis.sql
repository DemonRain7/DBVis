He’s all about the pioneer spirit, living in a world where he’s no longer able to use his skills, until he encounters a team of scientists led by Professor Brand and his daughter Amelia (Michael Caine and Anne Hathaway), They have a plan to leave earth in order to find new inhabitable worlds since, as Brand puts it, “mankind was born on earth, it wasn’t meant to die here”.<br><br><br>This sends <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span>, Amelia and another pair of astronauts on a two-year journey to a wormhole that’s been discovered near Saturn, and to whatever lies beyond that. That’s all you really need to know, because from this point in there are many thrills and surprises to be discovered in a film that’s all about what we leave behind for future generations. There are echoes of 2001 in its silent, balletic space sequences, as well as in some of the more surreal imagery that <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span> unleashes in the later stages.<br><br>A lot of the time it’s hard science, as actual rocket scientists come up with plans for how to save mankind. Questions of relative time may scramble the brain, but it’s done with the utmost sincerity and not without humour, which is a welcome touch. It’s not an action film, certainly not a single-minded one like Gravity, so that shouldn’t be expected, but when <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span> does throw some in, he runs with ideas and visuals that make for jaw-dropping sequences.<br><br>For all its spectacle though, it’s the immense force of the human drama that gives <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> its impact. The implications and the scale of what we’re dealing with here can be difficult to contemplate, and when it concentrates on its profound examination of humanity, it approaches brilliance.<br><br><br>In most regards, this is exactly what we should be demanding from our blockbusters. It’s conceived with intelligence and far-reaching intent and executed with immense skill, yet it never quite achieves that moment of transcendence that it seems to threaten for the first two hours.<br><br>There’s plenty of room for trimming in its much too generous running time, and <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span> throws into the mix the kinds of characters and plot developments you might expect from lesser filmmakers, undoing a lot of good work in a final hour that at times can be sluggish and ponderous.<br><br>So the year’s most anticipated film has turned out to be a good one, at times a very good one. But in the end does it really amount to much more than you might find in the very best episodes of Star Trek?<br><br>\n',NULL,'expert',0.1160,0.0630,0.8210,0.9888),(0,'0_10','\"2014.11.11\"','Alex Withrow ','<span id=\"director\"><span id=\"director\"><span id=\"director\">Nolan</span></span> <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span></span>’s <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> opens in an undisclosed place at an undisclosed time in the future. And though the setting is opaque, the film makes it immediately clear that life on Earth is running out. Cities are unseen, populations are low, the military is nonexistent – all that remains is the need for steady farming, and the will to combat the dust that blankets every feasible area. The dust is so thick on Earth that a thin layer of it can be seen on most every surface. On the kitchen table, in the principal’s office, in the car, on the pillows – it’s everywhere. And by now, it’s killed every crop except corn, which we soon learn is too in short supply. Corn is how we’re introduced to <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span> (Matthew McConaughey), a farmer and single father of two who gave up his career as an engineer, to literally help cultivate the Earth.<br><br>Although <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> will likely be remembered as a “space movie,” credit needs to be given to the way <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span> handles the first act of his film. The editing is brisk but patient, the characters are almost universally melancholic, and rarely share fond memories of days past. There’s a distinctly Terrence Malick vibe to these opening scenes, which, without warning, quickly evolve into something far different.<br><br>A string of seemingly random events helps <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span> and his young daughter, <span id=\"character\">Murph</span> (Mackenzie Foy), discover that NASA has been secretly prepping a new mission to save humankind. The mission: travel to three newly-discovered planets and determine if human life is sustainable on them. <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span> is the only living (and/or willing) NASA pilot, so he’s recruited by his former mentor, Professor Brand (Michael Caine), to lead the mission with Brand’s daughter (Anne Hathaway). <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span> accepts the task, but struggles to say goodbye to <span id=\"character\">Murph</span> as he’s unable to tell her when and if he’ll ever return.<br><br>Once the mission commences, <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> becomes the new standard for the space film. With each passing scene, it feels as though <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span> and his crew had a keen interest in changing the game, or, at the very least, abandoning the rules and creating new ones. This is chiefly evident in Hans Zimmer’s bombastic score, perhaps the finest he’s ever composed. His music, all but void of the standard orchestral strings and thundering drums that accompany most big movie scores, is truly its own character in <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span>. There are moments, for example, when the music is intentionally louder than the actors’ dialogue, as if the score is meant to act as a character with a more dominant voice. It’s one of the finest modern musical scores I can recall; an essential component to <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span>’s overall greatness.<br><br>But, of course, there are many things in play here. Hoyte Van Hoytema’s wondrous cinematography, Lee Smith’s seamless editing, and the flawless production design and art direction all help create a world that is distinctly new. <span id=\"director\"><span id=\"director\"><span id=\"director\">Nolan</span></span> <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span></span> co-wrote the script with his brother Jonathan, and together, they have created a masterful, intricate puzzle of a film. In fact, the inner workings of <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> are so detailed that to describe the performances of specific actors would be to reveal too much about the complex plot. If I told you who Jessica Chastain shared scenes with, for example, much of the mystery of the film would be ruined.<br><br><br><span id=\"character\">Cooper</span> is the first dad Matthew McConaughey has played since his self-imposed “McConaissance” began in 2011. Sure, his work in Mud was a predominantly parental role, but <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span> is a dad’s dad. He loves his kids and appears to live every waking moment with them at the forefront of his mind. Perhaps it’s presumptive of me to suggest that McConaughey drew from his own experiences as a father while playing <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span>, but whatever he was doing, it was clearly working. <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span> is arguably the most emotive work McConaughey has delivered yet. For my money, it’s a far more layered and complete performance than his Oscar-winning turn in Dallas Buyers Club. The actor has showed immeasurable promise in the past three years, and I still had no idea he had this in him.<br><br>Our big budget movies are manufactured with the uniqueness of an aged assembly line. The stories, the way the films look, sound, and behave are all interchangeable. The actor’s faces might be different (though, in the world of super hero films, they rarely are) and the character’s names might be altered, but for all intents and purposes, blockbusters have little to offer in the way of lasting contribution. This is precisely what separates a <span id=\"director\"><span id=\"director\"><span id=\"director\">Nolan</span></span> <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span></span> film from other films of this size. The man makes big and bold and beautiful movies, with <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> being his best blockbuster yet. This is a profoundly unique film, the definition of pure cinema.<br><br>Pure cinema. A phrase tossed around a lot these days. The phrase, to me, describes those precious moments in film where everything clicks together. Score, cinematography, performance, direction – every component of the filmmaking process is perfectly married, if only for a moment. Pure cinema is hard to find, and when I discover such a moment, I make it a point to call it out. There’s a scene in <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> that defines pure cinema. To the best of my knowledge, it’s a scene we’ve witnessed in nearly every movie that has been set in space: the docking sequence. One smaller vessel docks with another, larger vessel, thereby becoming one. In most movies, the docking scene is a minuscule event; something that shows how characters on the small vessel boarded the large vessel. In <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span>, the docking scene is a matter of life and death. As I sat and watched the sequence, my jaw literally dropped from the thrill of it all. Zimmer’s organ-heavy music pounded away, the ship spun round and round, characters tried to stay conscious, the organs, the spinning. Beautiful. Alive. Pure cinema. At some point, my dropped jaw became a stunned smile and I noticed that a few tears were running down my face.

It is by turns edgy, breathtaking, hopeful, and heartbreaking. It\'s an amazing achievement that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible. <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span> has crafted <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> as a movie theater experience. Watching it at home, no matter how good the sound system is, won\'t match. This is one time when the IMAX surcharge is worth it.<br><br><span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> is science fiction. It\'s not space opera. It\'s not futuristic fantasy. It\'s what the term \"science fiction\" was coined to represent. It presents a viable future in which space travel, while possible, is dangerous and uncertain. Starships aren\'t zipping from planet to planet. Space craft aren\'t firing lasers, phasers, or photon torpedoes. Travel across long distances uses the dangerous and unpredictable method of entering a wormhole, not engaging Warp One or making the jump to hyperspace. Time dilation comes into effect in the presence of a black hole and there\'s even a little bit about the relationship between quantum mechanics and relativity. This isn\'t Star Wars, Star Trek, or Guardians of the Galaxy, and anyone who approaches it with such expectations will be disappointed. It\'s more along the lines of recent movies like Contact (which also starred Matthew McConaughey) and Gravity in that it acknowledges science rather than ignoring the rules of reality as we understand them.<br><br>It will be difficult to find a review of <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> that doesn\'t reference 2001: A Space Odyssey and there\'s a valid reason for that. <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span> at times uses Stanley Kubrick\'s masterpiece as a template, especially during moments of grandeur. Hans Zimmer\'s score is no less crucial to <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> than \"Also Sprach Zarathustra\" was to 2001. Yet, this is no mere copy of Kubrick\'s film; in fact, it goes far afield. There\'s heroism, a la The Right Stuff. It\'s also a warmer, more emotional experience - less stately and abstruse. In fact, found at the core of this big budget adventure is the most relatable thing imaginable: the feelings of love and trust that bind father and daughter. It\'s almost a fusion of Kubrick and Spielberg.<br><br><span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> opens at an unspecified future date in America\'s farm belt. Although the film is careful not to identify a year, it\'s probably around 2050. The world has fallen victim to famine caused by overpopulation and a blight that is killing crops and creating massive dust storms. With nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere, total asphyxiation is the inevitable endgame. Earth as a bastion of humanity is doomed. Former NASA engineer and test pilot <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span> (Matthew McConaughey) owns acres of corn that he farms along with his family: son Tom, daughter <span id=\"character\">Murph</span> (Mackenzie Foy), and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). Drawn by almost supernatural means to a chain-link fence around a super-secret location, <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span> finds himself face-to-face with what remains of his former employer: an underground think-tank dedicated to saving the human race. Led by Professor Brand (Michael Caine), NASA has developed two plans. The first involves creating a massive space vehicle to transport as many humans as possible into outer space. The second involves using frozen embryos to colonize a distant world. There are problems with Plan A - namely, overcoming gravity to launch the massive space ship - but Brand is convinced he can solve the necessary equations that will make this possible.<br><br><span id=\"character\">Cooper</span> learns that a wormhole has appeared in space near Saturn, presumably placed there by (alien) entities of great intelligence intent upon giving humanity a path of survival. Ten years ago, astronauts were sent through to scout the dozen potentially habitable planets on the other side. Now another craft must make the journey to determine humankind\'s final destination. Mindful that his children\'s future is at stake, <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span> agrees to pilot the craft. He is accompanied by a small crew of four: Brand\'s daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway); scientists Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi); and the sardonic robot TARS (Bill Irwin), who recalls HAL 9000. <span id=\"character\">Murph</span> is resentful of her father for abandoning her - an anger she nurses into adulthood, when (now played by Jessica Chastain), she becomes Brand\'s second-in-charge working for the same entity that took her father away from her.<br><br>Like Contact, <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> displays an uncanny knack for making complex physics accessible to laymen (partial credit to Executive Producer and CalTech physicist Kip Thorne). Yes, there are times when the dialogue is dense but it never becomes impenetrable (although there are some odd passages, such as one in which <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span> and Amelia discuss the meaning of \"love\"). Does the movie occasionally fudge? Of course, but it sticks closer to Einstein\'s laws than most space-faring movies and when it speculates, it does so in a believable manner.<br><br>The movie remains Earthbound for its first 45 minutes, establishing a dire scenario for the planet and depicting the day-to-day struggles of those who survive in this blasted, inhospitable future.

The film deserves the label of an \"experience\" and the bigger the venue, the more immersive it will be. As event movies go, this is one of the most unique and mesmerizing.\n\nInterstellar is science fiction. It\'s not space opera. It\'s not futuristic fantasy. It\'s what the term \"science fiction\" was coined to represent. It presents a viable future in which space travel, while possible, is dangerous and uncertain. Starships aren\'t zipping from planet to planet. Space craft aren\'t firing lasers, phasers, or photon torpedoes. Travel across long distances uses the dangerous and unpredictable method of entering a wormhole, not engaging Warp One or making the jump to hyperspace. Time dilation comes into effect in the presence of a black hole and there\'s even a little bit about the relationship between quantum mechanics and relativity. This isn\'t Star Wars, Star Trek, or Guardians of the Galaxy, and anyone who approaches it with such expectations will be disappointed. It\'s more along the lines of recent movies like Contact (which also starred Matthew McConaughey) and Gravity in that it acknowledges science rather than ignoring the rules of reality as we understand them.\n\nIt will be difficult to find a review of Interstellar that doesn\'t reference 2001: A Space Odyssey and there\'s a valid reason for that. Nolan at times uses Stanley Kubrick\'s masterpiece as a template, especially during moments of grandeur. Hans Zimmer\'s score is no less crucial to Interstellar than \"Also Sprach Zarathustra\" was to 2001. Yet, this is no mere copy of Kubrick\'s film; in fact, it goes far afield. There\'s heroism, a la The Right Stuff. It\'s also a warmer, more emotional experience - less stately and abstruse. In fact, found at the core of this big budget adventure is the most relatable thing imaginable: the feelings of love and trust that bind father and daughter. It\'s almost a fusion of Kubrick and Spielberg.\n\nInterstellar opens at an unspecified future date in America\'s farm belt. Although the film is careful not to identify a year, it\'s probably around 2050. The world has fallen victim to famine caused by overpopulation and a blight that is killing crops and creating massive dust storms. With nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere, total asphyxiation is the inevitable endgame. Earth as a bastion of humanity is doomed. Former NASA engineer and test pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) owns acres of corn that he farms along with his family: son Tom, daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy), and father-in-law Donald (John Lithgow). Drawn by almost supernatural means to a chain-link fence around a super-secret location, Cooper finds himself face-to-face with what remains of his former employer: an underground think-tank dedicated to saving the human race. Led by Professor Brand (Michael Caine), NASA has developed two plans. The first involves creating a massive space vehicle to transport as many humans as possible into outer space. The second involves using frozen embryos to colonize a distant world. There are problems with Plan A - namely, overcoming gravity to launch the massive space ship - but Brand is convinced he can solve the necessary equations that will make this possible.\n\nCooper learns that a wormhole has appeared in space near Saturn, presumably placed there by (alien) entities of great intelligence intent upon giving humanity a path of survival. Ten years ago, astronauts were sent through to scout the dozen potentially habitable planets on the other side. Now another craft must make the journey to determine humankind\'s final destination. Mindful that his children\'s future is at stake, Cooper agrees to pilot the craft. He is accompanied by a small crew of four: Brand\'s daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway); scientists Doyle (Wes Bentley) and Romilly (David Gyasi); and the sardonic robot TARS (Bill Irwin), who recalls HAL 9000. Murph is resentful of her father for abandoning her - an anger she nurses into adulthood, when (now played by Jessica Chastain), she becomes Brand\'s second-in-charge working for the same entity that took her father away from her.\n\nLike Contact, Interstellar displays an uncanny knack for making complex physics accessible to laymen (partial credit to Executive Producer and CalTech physicist Kip Thorne). Yes, there are times when the dialogue is dense but it never becomes impenetrable (although there are some odd passages, such as one in which Cooper and Amelia discuss the meaning of \"love\"). Does the movie occasionally fudge? Of course, but it sticks closer to Einstein\'s laws than most space-faring movies and when it speculates, it does so in a believable manner.\n\nThe movie remains Earthbound for its first 45 minutes, establishing a dire scenario for the planet and depicting the day-to-day struggles of those who survive in this blasted, inhospitable future. Most importantly, however, this part of the film establishes the closeness of the relationship between Cooper and Murph and introduces the mystery of \"them\" - the mysterious \"ghosts\" who will play a part on the periphery for the rest of the movie. In the end, Cooper must embrace the philosophy that \"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\" He promises to Murph that he will return, knowing he may not be able to keep that promise.\n\nOnce in space, the white knuckle moments begin. Limiting the use of CGI, Nolan relies on practical effects to craft a movie that feels more like a real journey than a video game. There are some tremendous action set pieces and the narrative is wonderfully unpredictable. The movie takes some chances with its endgame, which resolves a lot of plot points but at times seems rushed.

Hans Zimmer delivers an operatic score that, although occasionally drowning out dialogue (more a mixing issue than a scoring one), adds to the overall experience. Sound is important to Interstellar - when the rocket lifts off around the 45-minute mark, the bass shakes the entire theater.\n\nIt has been a tremendous year for McConaughey. From Dallas Buyers Club to True Detective to Interstellar, he has won a Golden Globe and an Oscar and been nominated for an Emmy. Interstellar will give him another opportunity for Academy recognition: he\'s the glue that holds everything together. He\'s the human factor in a vast universe.

It’s meant to be Saturn, but it could just as well be Earth, where environmental recklessness has morphed the planet into a Dirt Bowl starving and choking its citizens.<br><br><span id=\"director\">Nolan</span> spends the first third of the film in the American farm belt of the near future, introducing us to widower <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span> (McConaughey), a former test pilot, who depends on his father-in-law (John Lithgow) to help him raise 15-year-old son Tom (Timothée Chalamet) and 10-year-old daughter <span id=\"character\">Murph</span>y (Mackenzie Foy, superb). Like her dad, <span id=\"character\">Murph</span> is a rebel who refuses to buy into her school’s official dictum that the Apollo space program was a lie.<br><br>It’s when dad and daughter find the remnants of NASA, headed up by <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span>’s old boss Professor Brand (Michael Caine), that the story gains momentum. <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span> heads into space to find a new world to colonize, leaving behind two kids who may never forgive him.<br>The physics lessons (Cal-tech’s Kip Thorne consulted) kick in when Coop captains the Endurance mother ship with a science team made up of Amelia (Anne Hathaway), Brand’s daughter; Romilly (David Gyasi); and Doyle (Wes Bentley). And don’t forget R2-D2 and C-3PO. Not really. The ex-military robots of <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> are called CASE and TARS. The great Bill Irwin voices TARS, a chatty monolith that looks like something out of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey and sounds like that film’s HAL. (Note to viewers: Kubrick’s 1968 landmark and George Lucas’ Star Wars franchise are part of <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span>’s DNA. React accordingly.)<br><br>Next comes the wow factor that makes <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> nirvana for movie lovers. A high-tension docking maneuver. A surprise visitor. A battle on the frozen tundra. A tidal wave the size of a mountain. Cheers to <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span> and his team, led by cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema and VFX supervisor Paul J. Franklin (Inception). See <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> in IMAX, with the thrilling images oomphed by Hans Zimmer’s score, and you’ll get the meaning of “rock the house.”<br>And yet it’s the final, quieter hour of <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> that gives the film resonance and lasting value. All the talk of black holes, wormholes and the space-time continuum take root in Coop when he realizes his two years in space have occupied 23 years on Earth. His children, the now-adult Tom (Casey Affleck) and <span id=\"character\">Murph</span>y (Jessica Chastain), spill out decades of joys and resentments in video messages that Coop watches in stunned silence. McConaughey nails every nuance without underlining a single one of them. He’s a virtuoso, his face a road map to the life he’s missed as his children bombard him with a Rorschach test of emotions.<br><br>In case you haven’t noticed, McConaughey is on a roll. And he partners beautifully with the sublime Chastain, who infuses <span id=\"character\">Murph</span> with amazing grit and grace. Familial love is the topic here, not the romantic or sexual kind. How does that figure into space exploration? <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span> gives Hathaway a monologue about it. But dialogue is no match for the flinty eloquence shining from the eyes of McConaughey and Chastain. They are the bruised heart of <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span>, a film that trips up only when it tries to make love a science with rules to be applied. In 2001, Kubrick saw a future that was out of our hands. For <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span>, our reliance on one another is all we’ve got. That’s more the stuff of provocation than a Hallmark e-card. <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span> believes it’s better to think through a movie than to just sit through it. If that makes him a white knight, Godspeed.\nThis is big. It’s huge. We don’t make movies like this anymore — we hardly ever did. I’m not talking about big in the sense of budget or even big like epic. We do that plenty: spend the GDP of a small nation to make men in capes fly or monsters stomp or toys sing.

Perhaps his aims are too ambitious at times, but you can never accuse him of making an everyday film. He always shoots for the moon (or better yet a wormhole) and so his projects are ultimately better than most, even if they miss the target a bit. The reason being, <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> is still full of enough questions and concepts to leave us thinking for a good long time after we leave the theater.<br><br>Although approximately 2 hours and 49 minutes, hardly anyone could call <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> too long, because it is more often than not engaging, as we try and decipher where <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span> is going to take us next. His story starts on a world that is certainly earth but strangely dystopian compared to the planet that we know and love. Reminiscent of When Harry Met Sally or something, old folks speak of the way the world was when the dust first hit and the corn crops had to be burned. Not much explanation is given but it is what it is.<br><br>This is the climate that the engineer-turned-farmer Coop (Matthew McConaughey) has to raise his two kids after his wife passed away. They are good kids for the most part. <span id=\"character\">Murph</span> blames a so-called “ghost” for accidents that happen around the house and her brother teases her some. But they hardly complain about this life they have they; just push forward.<br><br>However, their father has always been an explorer at heart, a pilot who never got to truly test the vast seas of space or spread out his wings fully. That changes when he and his daughter come across an old relic from the past. No, it’s not a monolith but something far more human. He somewhat reluctantly teams up with his old professor Brandt (Sir Michael Caine) and the professor’s daughter Amelia(Anne Hathaway) in a major undertaking.<br><br>They want Coop to pilot a mission to a wormhole which is just out of humanity’s reach. It was seemingly miraculously gifted to the human race by some unknown third person. This is their chance to A: find a new planet for a mass exodus or B: restart a colony on a far away destination. The first option is far less grim. Coop takes the mission in the hopes of saving his kids, but he knows the ramifications. Since time is all relative he does not know when he is coming back. He does not even know what he will find or if he will be successful. He heads off as an angry <span id=\"character\">Murph</span> tearfully watches him fall out of her life.<br><br>In a match cut of his own, <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span> transports Coop from his truck to the outer reaches of the galaxy. The real adventure has begun. The mission is clear. Save humanity from most certain extinction. It does not make it easier however that messages are constantly being relayed from earth. Coop and his three colleagues set up a plan of action. Their first target is a water covered environment that looks promising. Not so. Next, Coop overrules Brandt and they head to a desolate world that a previous explorer had labeled as inhabitable. To put it bluntly, he lied and he was not the only one.<br><br>Now <span id=\"character\">Murph</span> is older (Jessica Chastain) and she still has a hard time reconciling the departure of her dad. In an especially impactful scene, a still ageless Coop watches tearfully as his older son’s life literally passes before his eyes through the video communications that have been relayed up.<br><br>Coop has no way to reply. He can only watch and push forward to try and find a solution. But the answers are few and far between as time continues to move rapidly faster on earth than with the crew of the Endurance. In one final act of selfless valor Coop heads into a black hole and thus begins his own mind-blowing leg of his space odyssey. Some connections are made and when all the pieces are put together all that really matters is his inextinguishable love and family. In the end, Coop spends a nice moment with his daughter under very different circumstances. Together they saved the human race. Together they survived.<br><br>For a film that was made for Physic nerds with talk of black holes, worm holes, relativity, quantum mechanics, Newton’s Third Law, gravity and the like, <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span>’s conclusion has a universal ring. As Amelia Brand claims, “Love is the one thing that transcends time and space.” There are still scientific questions left to be debated for years to come, but we know that love is one thing that is forever true.<br><br>There are obviously numerous comparisons that can be made between <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> and 2001. I would rather focus on the differences very briefly. In <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span>’s film, A.I. is actually useful and more reliable and kind than humanity itself. It is Man who lies, cheats and reverts to animalistic behavior all in the name of survival. <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> has a lot of scientific theory behind it (which I will acknowledge I do not know the ins and outs of), however, it also has a very human component. It is grounded on earth with Coop’s kids.<br><br>The visuals in <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span> are often breathtaking but we would probably expect that for such an ambitious space saga. What I really took out of this film was the score and juxtaposition of sound. Hans Zimmer’s compositions were full of pounding organs that somehow fit the mood with their majestic and still austere sound. Furthermore, this film had a lot of dialogue and tense moments of noise, however, when we are outside the spacecraft it is almost completely silent reminding us of the reality of space. It is more often than not a vast, silent unknown.<br><br>I am reminded of when Coop explains to his daughter why she was named after <span id=\"character\">Murph</span>y’s Law which seems to be bad. He replies that “<span id=\"character\">Murph</span>y’s law doesn’t mean that something bad will happen. It means that whatever can happen, will happen.” And that was good enough for Coop and his late wife. In some ways I think these words can be used to describe <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span>. With <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span>, there is the potential that whatever can happen, will. There is excitement and magic in that, even if it sometimes overshoots its bounds.

All of this is idealized within the movie\'s protagonist, <span id=\"character\">Cooper</span> (Matthew McConaughey).  Formerly a NASA test pilot, he is now a farmer - one of many struggling to maintain the Earth\'s food supply after an unexplained plant disease and apocalyptic dust storms have driven most terrestrial crops to extinction.

Bringing along scientists Brand (Anne Hathaway), Doyle (Wes Bentley), and Romilly (David Gyasi) - the astronaut business is is a surname-only affair - and a couple of impractical-looking yet extremely versatile A.I. machines, the mission predictably runs into complications and devolves into a series of gripping life-or-death choices.<br><br>The problem with <span id=\"movie\">Interstellar</span>, however, is that <span id=\"director\">Nolan</span> frequently sacrifices clarity for density, and then confuses it for depth.

A sphere of distortion, like the one they encountered in the first wormhole, is directly in front of Doyle, hovering at a point in the middle of the cabin. Doyle points a finger gently at the sphere, which grows in response. Brand pulls herself into the cabin. Several more points appear, as if they\'ve been summoned by the first. Some of the points twist, some of them spin, and some of them are motionless.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: I think these are the creatures that built the wormhole. One of them begins to move closer to Cooper.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: This thing is made of... gravity?<br>C: BRAND<br>D: No. I don\'t think it\'s in our universe at all. I think it lives in the bulk -- the space that the wormholes traverse. And it can only interact with us using gravity. The shape playfully grows around Cooper\'s hand, bending the space it\'s in, stretching the skin. Doyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body, coming to rest in the middle and bending his entire torso like a fun house mirror. Suddenly, the sphere wrapped around Cooper\'s hand begins moving, tugging him gently through the cabin. In the next moment, all three of them are being propelled through the cabin. It\'s a magical moment -- a communion, a dance between creatures on either side of a massive, invisible wall. Doyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled around the room.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Can we communicate with them?<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Where would we even start?<br>N: Maybe-- She pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and tears the bag open, releasing a cloud of the tiny shining globes into the air. For a moment, nothing happens. Then, the distortions begin moving through the bearings, shifting them, rearranging them into patterns in the air. First, they rearrange the ball bearings into clusters, then shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around a medium-sized star.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: That\'s our solar system. After a moment the ball bearings break apart again and rearrange into a larger, more complicated system -- Gargantua, Pantagruel, and the ice planet. Finally, the bearings compress to a two-dimensional sheet. Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits around the stars and then pushes up, off of the sheet, into an umbrella shaped space that rises up from the sheet.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: What is that?

As they grow closer, they realize that it\'s an opening. They are inside a massive, hollow sphere. They have been the entire time. The ship is guided out through the opening at the crown of the sphere. Below them is an astonishing sight: Our entire universe, compressed into a flattened disc, like a floor of stars. They are hovering above it, in the bulk, the space between universes. INT. ENDURANCE, BULK Brand and the others stare at the incredible display.

KELLY<br>D: Yes, Mr. Cooper. The kind of wastefulness and excess that the 20th century represented. Your children would be better off learning about this planet, rather than reading fantasies about leaving it. Cooper is silent for a long moment.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI. If we had any of them left the doctors might have been able to find the cyst in my wife\'s brain before she died, rather than afterwards. And then my kids could have been raised by two parents, instead of me and their pain-in-the-ass grandfather. Ms. Kelly\'s face falls, ashen.
