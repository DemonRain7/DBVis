                                        conference table. The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly,
                                        some DIA. The door opens and
                                        his assistant steps in. Armed guards pat him down, then shove him into a
                                        seat.<br>C: ANSEN<br>D: Is that
                                        really necessary? One of the NSA agents leans forward.<br>C: NSA AGENT<br>D:
                                        You've been complaining for
                                        years that the government doesn't take your project seriously enough, Doctor.
                                        You can't have it both ways.
                                        Ansen motions to his assistant, who turns on a projector. On-screen, we see the
                                        familiar pulse and
                                        echoes.<br>E: smiles<br>C: ANSEN<br>D: Yesterday morning, our facility in

                                        neutron star colliding with a supermassive black hole. We went through the last
                                        year's data and triangulated
                                        the source. The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron star
                                        circling into the black
                                        hole.<br>C: NSA AGENT<br>D: We know that, Doctor. What we don't know is why,
                                        according to your numbers, this
                                        event took place right here in our own solar system. Suddenly, the image
                                        overlays the sun, the earth, and
                                        the rest of our solar system around the black hole.<br>C: ANSEN<br>D: It didn't.
                                        Because if it had we'd all
                                        be dead by now. On-screen, Jupiter, then the Earth and the inner planets are
                                        consumed by the black hole.
                                        Only the sun survives, pulled into orbit around its new master.<br>C:

                                        the black hole system is
                                        removed to a distant corner, connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time. A

                                        collision travels through the tunnel.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C: NSA AGENT<br>D: I've
                                        read your book, Doctor. You
                                        said that wormholes are impossible.<br>C: ANSEN<br>D: There is nothing quite as

                                        utterly wrong. I said that a wormhole couldn't exist naturally. Not for more
                                        than a few billionths of a

                                        pauses, unsure.<br>N: His assistant steps in to his defense.<br>C:
                                        ASSISTANT<br>D: We don't have any way to
                                        answer that question.<br>C: NSA AGENT<br>D: You're not under peer review here,
                                        Doctor. I don't care about
                                        your reputation. I need to know how that thing got there. Now. Ansen finally
                                        speaks up.<br>E: ignores

                                        pouring out of its open hood.
                                        A dozen MEN in BASEBALL UNIFORMS are standing around the front of the bus. A
                                        battered PICKUP pulls up, and a
                                        MAN, 30s, gets out, leaving his two SONS in the car. This is COOPER. He joins

                                        Probably Chinese. Everyone watches the fireworks as the satellite burns up in
                                        the upper atmosphere. After a
                                        moment, play resumes -- it's a pretty show, but everyone has seen it plenty of
                                        times before. Down on the
                                        field, the Dodgers' catcher misses an easy pop fly and the Yankees load the

                                        wrong. Murph, looking hurt, walks off.<br>E: CONT'D<br>N: Cooper turns to his
                                        son.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Find
                                        something to patch it with.<br>C: TOM<br>D: How am I supposed to do that?<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: Figure it out.
                                        I'm not always going to be here to help you. Cooper leaves Tom to catch up with
                                        his younger son, who is
                                        looking out over the river.<br>C: MURPH<br>D: Is that really why I'm named
                                        Murph, dad?<br>C: COOPER<br>D:
                                        Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't mean that. It means what can happen will
                                        happen. All kinds of things. Good
                                        or bad. And that's the way you want it to be. Why?<br>C: MURPH COOPER<br>D:
                                        Because if nothing ever happened
                                        to you then you wouldn't learn anything. Murph is staring off into the distance.
                                        Murph?<br>N: He's heard
                                        something.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLING SOUND.
                                        Cooper looks out over the
                                        river. Then he turns back and tackles his son to the ground. Suddenly, a MASSIVE
                                        AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so
                                        close they can almost touch it. It bounces the truck on its suspension, then
                                        soars off over the fields
                                        behind them. Cooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck. He pulls a laptop
                                        and an antenna made out of a
                                        Pringles can out of the back of the truck. He hands the laptop and antenna to
                                        Murph. Get in.<br>E:
                                        CONT'D<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Tom is still standing by the side of the road,
                                        wrestling with the jack.<br>E:
                                        CONT'D<br>C: TOM<br>D: What about the tire? INT. TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER The
                                        truck is SMASHING through the
                                        cornfields as fast as Cooper can push it on three good tires.<br>C: TOM<br>D: To
                                        the right, the dark shape
                                        of the Russian drone appears, flying low over the fields. Cooper jerks the
                                        wheel-EXT. RIVER -- DAY The truck
                                        BURSTS out of the corn and SPLASHES across the river and into an old, abandoned
                                        suburban housing development
                                        in the valley below, planted over with corn. Half a mile hugging the like an old
                                        tops of its<br>N: in front
                                        of them, the Russian drone is still ground. It has impossibly long, skinny
                                        wings, U-2 surveillance plane,
                                        but no cockpit. The wings are covered in black solar cells.<br><br></p>
                                    <p id=8>Scene 8: INT. TRUCK -- DAY<br>N: Murph is fiddling with the computer. His
                                        older brother takes the
                                        computer from him and fires up emulation software.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: It's a
                                        Chinese military drone. Solar
                                        cells could power an entire farm. Take the wheel. Cooper hands Murph the
                                        Pringles can antenna.<br>E: to
                                        Tom<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Keep it pointed right at it, OK? Murph nods. Tom takes
                                        the wheel as his dad works the
                                        laptop, trying to communicate with the huge Russian drone. The screen fills with
                                        Cyrillic characters.
                                        Faster, Tom.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I'm losing it.<br>E: CONT'D<br>N:
                                        Tom WEAVES the truck at speed
                                        through the old, curved streets of the development, past oversized suburban
                                        mansions planted over with corn.
                                        They round a corner and come face-to-face with a robot harvester. Tom jerks the
                                        wheel to avoid it. BANG --
                                        the truck loses a wing mirror against the flank of the combine.<br><br></p>
                                    <p id=9>Scene 9: EXT. SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT -- DAY<br>C：TOM<br>N: Tom guides the
                                        truck from street to street,
                                        trying to chart a straight path across the fields. The truck BOUNCES as it
                                        SMASHES through an old picket
                                        fence. Ahead, the drone is soaring, banking, pulling away.<br><br></p>
                                    <p id=10>Scene 10: INT. TRUCK -- DAY<br>C: COOPER<br>N: Cooper is still trying to
                                        hack into the drone's control
                                        circuitry as they leave the development behind and begin to climb into the
                                        foothills of the Sierras.<br><br>
                                    </p>

                                        along the spine of the
                                        hills. The drone soars overhead, making for the white tips of the
                                        Sierras.<br><br></p>
                                    <p id=12>Scene 12: INT. TRUCK -- DAY<br>N: Cooper is oblivious to the picturesque
                                        surroundings as he
                                        concentrates on the laptop. Dad? (unsure) TOM<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Almost got it.
                                        Don't slow down. In front of
                                        them, Tom and his brother watch as the drone plummets from view. DAD.<br>C:
                                        TOM<br>D: Cooper looks up.
                                        Ahead, the trail disappears as the edge of the hills falls away -- it's a three
                                        hundred-foot drop. Tom locks
                                        up the brakes. EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY The truck skids to a halt inches
                                        from a precipitous drop. Cooper
                                        climbs out, holding the laptop. Murph climbs out next to him, still pointing the
                                        Pringles can. We lost
                                        it.<br>C: TOM COOPER<br>D: No we didn't.<br>E: smiling<br>C: COOPER<br>D: You
                                        want to give it a whirl? Murph
                                        looks at his dad, wide-eyed. He takes the laptop and moves his fingers gingerly
                                        across the pad. In response,
                                        the massive plane banks into a tight turn in the valley below. For a moment,
                                        Murph is in pure heaven,
                                        sending the drone dancing through the valley below.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: Set her down in the
                                        valley -- there, next to the river. Murph leads the plane in a figure eight and
                                        then begins guiding it into
                                        a gentle landing in the valley floor below. EXT. ABANDONED GOLF COURSE, VALLEY
                                        FLOOR -- DAY The truck limps
                                        along the overgrown fairway of a long-defunct golf course towards the massive
                                        hulk of the Russian drone,
                                        Cooper and the boys climb down. The valley is silent save for the truck's engine
                                        WHEEZING and SPUTTERING as
                                        it cools. Cooper runs a hand over the smooth carbon flank of the drone.<br>E:
                                        CONT'D<br>C: TOM<br>D: How
                                        long do you think it's been up there, Dad?<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Chinese mission
                                        control went down same as us,
                                        twenty years ago. It's been up there ever since.<br>C: TOM<br>D: What was it
                                        doing flying so low? Cooper
                                        reads the information pouring into his laptop.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: It was looking
                                        for something. Intercepted
                                        some kind of signal. It's been at eighty thousand feet. Sun probably cooked its
                                        brain. Cooper runs his hand
                                        along the flank till he finds an access patch. He pulls out a crowbar and pries
                                        open the hatch. Inside,
                                        surrounded by a nest of liquid cooling tubes, is a small black module -- the
                                        drone's auto-pilot. Cooper
                                        looks down at Murph, who is standing at his elbow.<br>E: shrugs<br>C:
                                        MURPH<br>D: What are you going to do
                                        with it?<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Reprogram it. Give it something socially responsible
                                        to do like drive a combine
                                        or a tractor.<br>C: MURPH<br>D: Couldn't we just let it go? not hurting anyone.
                                        Cooper looks down at his
                                        son.<br>E: quiet<br>N: It's Good kid.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: We need all the help we
                                        can get, Murph. This thing
                                        has to adapt, just like the rest of us. Cooper gently pries the control module
                                        out. EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL --
                                        DAY It's a small school, so all the kids and parents waiting in front know
                                        exactly who's driving the pickup
                                        truck with half of a Russian spy plane hanging out of the bed as it pulls up.

                                        COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY Cooper is ushered into the office. The PRINCIPAL, 40s, an
                                        efficient-looking man, shakes
                                        his hand.<br>C: PRINCIPAL<br>D: Good to see you, Mr. Cooper. This is Ms. Kelly,
                                        Murph's teacher. Cooper
                                        smiles at Ms. KELLY, 30s, attractive.<br>C: PRINCIPAL<br>D: So we've gotten
                                        Tom's score back.
                                        Congratulations. He's going to make an excellent farmer. The principal slides a
                                        carbon copy across the desk
                                        to Cooper, who looks taken aback.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C: COOPER<br>D: What about

                                        PRINCIPAL<br>D: I'm sorry. I'm afraid Tom's score simply isn't high
                                        enough.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: What are you,

                                        Cooper looks down, swallowing

                                        propaganda. The Soviets
                                        spent years trying to build rockets and other useless machines.<br>C:

                                        MS. KELLY<br>D: Yes, Mr. Cooper. The kind of wastefulness and excess that the
                                        20th century represented. Your
                                        children would be better off learning about this planet, rather than reading
                                        fantasies about leaving it.
                                        Cooper is silent for a long moment.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: One of those useless
                                        machines they used to make was
                                        called an MRI. If we had any of them left the doctors might have been able to
                                        find the cyst in my wife's
                                        brain before she died, rather than afterwards. And then my kids could have been
                                        raised by two parents,
                                        instead of me and their pain-in-the-ass grandfather. Ms. Kelly's face falls,
                                        ashen. Most of it,
                                        anyway.<br>N: Cooper swallows his anger.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: You ever consider

                                        and humanity might have been for us to part company? Cooper gets up to leave.

                                        through a glade. He stops to get
                                        his bearings. Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk of the
                                        tree is red hot. Cooper steps
                                        back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged chimney stack. He looks up:
                                        the tree is venting steam.
                                        Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive tanks. The tanks
                                        are filling with a bubbling
                                        liquid -- some kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him. Cooper
                                        finally catches up with Murph
                                        at the edge of a clearing.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Careful. There's some kind of
                                        underground facility here. We
                                        might... Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something: Standing bolt
                                        upright in the middle of the
                                        clearing, wearing an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec
                                        ROBOT.<br>C: MURPH<br>D: Is it
                                        still... alive?<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't made them
                                        for thirty years. I've never
                                        seen one intact before. Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. Its
                                        alloy frame heavily tarnished
                                        and weather-beaten. It looks like it might have been standing here for
                                        decades.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I think
                                        we need to go, Murph.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C: MURPH<br>D: But can't we take it back?
                                        You could fix it up, get him
                                        to do chores.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: No. I don't know what this place is, but we're
                                        leaving. Murph, ignoring his
                                        father, steps forward to touch the robot. Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into
                                        action, picking up the boy and
                                        hoisting him up to eye level. Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot.
                                        The robot turns, dropping the
                                        boy, RIPS the rifle from Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the
                                        side of the water tank.
                                        Cooper punches him, then winces in agony. Murph picks up the rifle and begins
                                        HITTING the robot as hard as
                                        he can. The robot opens his mouth and addresses Cooper calmly in the clipped
                                        tones of a US marine.<br>C:
                                        ROBOT<br>D: Tell the boy to stop hitting me.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Hit him in the
                                        back of the neck. Murph
                                        raises the rifle butt.<br>E: ignoring him<br>N: A voice stops him.<br>C: VOICE I
                                        wouldn't do that.<br>D: A
                                        woman, 30s, step out from the trees. This is AMELIA BRAND -tough, bright, and a
                                        decent shot with the large
                                        rifle that she's pointing at Cooper.<br>E: O.S.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: We were just
                                        looking for salvage.<br>C:
                                        BRAND<br>D: Is that what they call stealing these days?<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I
                                        didn't know it belonged to
                                        anyone.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: It doesn't. You want to let them go, Tars, or do you
                                        want some help with your
                                        work? The robot, evidently named Tars, looks at Cooper closely. Then lets him
                                        go.<br>E: to robot<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: You've got me wrong, lady.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Really? You're not the
                                        kind of guy who turns a
                                        combat marine with a supercomputer for a brain into a riding lawn mower? Cooper
                                        says nothing -- she's not
                                        that far off the mark.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Get back in your little plane, go back
                                        to your farming commune. And
                                        don't come back. Cooper backs up.<br>E: CONT'D<br>N: Tars holds up his mangled
                                        rifle. Smiles.<br>C:
                                        TARS<br>D: Don't forget your gun.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Word of advice -- careful
                                        with that thing. When the war
                                        was over, they didn't know when to stop fighting.<br>E: points at Tars<br>C:
                                        BRAND<br>D: I'd trust him a lot
                                        more than I'd trust you. Keep moving. Cooper backs up to his plane.<br>N: Tars
                                        follows him. Suddenly, in the
                                        plane, the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL. Tars responds instantly, striding
                                        past Cooper to the plane. He
                                        sees the probe. Tries to open the door. It's locked.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Wait a
                                        second-Tars TEARS the door
                                        off the plane. Reaches inside and pulls out the probe. The woman looks at it,
                                        stunned.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Get
                                        it inside.<br>E: MORE<br>C: BRAND<br>D: You too. We'll figure out what to do
                                        with you later. Tars stops, and
                                        two panels open in the ground, revealing a huge, reinforced service elevator.

                                        begins to glide diagonally down a tunnel that cuts hundreds of feet below the

                                        BRAND<br>D: This doesn't belong
                                        to you.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: You're right. It belongs to NASA, which shut down
                                        thirty years ago when the
                                        federal government ran out of money. Brand says nothing. The elevator slows to a
                                        stop at the bottom of the
                                        tunnel. Heavy BLAST DOORS grind open and Brand motions for Cooper to step
                                        forward. INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER
                                        -- DAY They step into a vast underground facility. Standing in the center,
                                        braced by a launch tower, is a
                                        ten story tall rocket. Dozens of ROBOTS are working on in, maintaining it.
                                        Cooper, stunned, looks at
                                        Brand.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Who are you people?<br>C: BRAND<br>D: The government
                                        gave us plenty of practice
                                        looking for our own funding. Keep moving. Tars carries the probe over to an area
                                        of the hangar filled with
                                        electronic equipment. A group of ENGINEERS and ROBOTS converge around Tars. An
                                        OLDER ENGINEER looks familiar
                                        -- 70s, white-haired, this is Ansen's assistant at Caltech who we met fifty
                                        years earlier.<br>E: wry
                                        gestures with rifle<br>C: BRAND<br>D: I found them outside with it. It looks
                                        like six. Maybe seven. I can't
                                        tell from the radiation damage. The older engineer looks at the probe,
                                        astonished.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C: OLD
                                        ENGINEER<br>D: Where did you find it?<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Galveston.<br>C:
                                        BRAND'S FATHER<br>D: Of course. It
                                        must have been looking for Canaveral. Tars bolts the probe down into a purpose
                                        built rig. DOYLE, 40s, an
                                        engineer, begins hooking leads into the probe.<br>E: thinking it over<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: Canaveral's been
                                        gone for thirty years. Brand ignores him. Doyle looks up from his monitor,
                                        frustrated.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D:
                                        It's not responding to the handshake. I can't open anything on primary. Brand
                                        looks up at Cooper.<br>C:
                                        BRAND<br>D: What did you do to it? Nothing.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I got something
                                        off of it.<br>N: Cooper looks
                                        around. There's a safety station on the wall with a battery powered
                                        defibrillator.<br>C: COOPER<br>E: CONT'D
                                        to Brand<br>C: May I?<br>D: Brand nods, wary. Cooper walks over to the wall,
                                        takes the defibrillator, and
                                        hooks it up to the probe. He taps into the current and runs a lead into the
                                        terminal. Brand's Father
                                        watches, fascinated, as Cooper fires the defibrillator.<br>C: OLD ENGINEER<br>D:
                                        Of course. The high voltage
                                        allows you to image the entire memory unit at once. Information begins appearing
                                        on the terminal's

                                        monitor starts pulling good data off of the probe. The older man and Doyle begin
                                        sorting through it. Cooper
                                        smiles at Brand, who seems less than impressed. The footage of the ice-covered
                                        planet Cooper saw earlier
                                        pops onto the screen. The engineers and physicists get very quiet, studying the
                                        images.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: It
                                        found something. Very thin nitrogen-based atmosphere. Trace radiation. Surface
                                        is ninety percent frozen
                                        water. Ten percent rock -- sedimentary composition similar to limestone. Wow.
                                        Pockets of oxygen below the
                                        surface. Lots and lots of oxygen. This could be the one, boss. The older
                                        engineer studies the image of the

                                        Brand looks at Cooper,

                                        abandoned machine shop, surrounded by the massive remains of rocket engines in
                                        various states of disrepair.
                                        Tars is blocking the door. Cooper stands. Tars wags a long, hydraulic finger at

                                        five hundred years. Cooper

                                        with a group of older ROBOTS
                                        who are overhauling an engine. One problem -- the engine isn't there. Their
                                        programming hasn't been updated
                                        to reflect their obsolescence. Murph watches, entranced, as the robots go about
                                        their business, efficiently
                                        TORQUING bolts with impact drivers into a non-existent thruster cone. The bolts

                                        lab that Brand and the older engineer are arguing about something. She finally
                                        relents and walks towards the

                                        in charge. But he decided
                                        that we needed someone who could lead the mission for the foreseeable future.

                                        will. We've grown a dozen
                                        forms of it that can. It's just a matter of time before the same ones develop

                                        scavenging just to get by. The earth
                                        has had enough of us. We have two, maybe three generations left. Then our time

                                        dripping wet, holding the
                                        telemetry board, struggles to keep pace with Brand through stacks of equipment
                                        and years of research and
                                        experimentation.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: You can set that down over there. Cooper sets
                                        the board down. His eye is
                                        drawn to a bizarre experiment -- an ant colony built into a massive spinning
                                        centrifuge. Brand
                                        notices.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: We didn't know what kind of gravity to expect. We
                                        experimented with collective
                                        organisms in high g environments.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C: COOPER<br>D: We're taking
                                        ants with us?<br>C:
                                        BRAND<br>D: Humans are also collective organisms.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I thought
                                        humans were more
                                        solitary.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Why am I not surprised? Cooper looks at the tiny
                                        colonies of ants struggling to
                                        go about their business in the raised gravity.<br>E: wry<br>C: COOPER<br>D:
                                        Looks like hard work.<br>C:
                                        BRAND<br>D: It's a paradox. Life couldn't form without gravity. No stars. No
                                        planets. The component pieces
                                        would just drift apart. But too much of it and you're trapped. Brand's guard
                                        relaxes a tiny bit as she talks
                                        about her work. The moment passes quickly, and she continues on into the stack

                                        nods. She ignores

                                        parameters based on the data from
                                        the probe. Case switches the map to a vista filled with stars and black
                                        holes.<br>C: CASE<br>D: Based on our
                                        latest modelling we think the region on the far side of the wormhole is the
                                        center of a galaxy. Case zooms
                                        in on the center of the hologram: an incredibly bright mass with plasma jets
                                        firing off in either

                                        There are several in the region, but this is the largest -a billion times
                                        heavier than the sun. I call it
                                        Gargantua. Beautiful, isn't it? It's a shame we won't get to see it up
                                        close.<br>E: smiles<br>C: DOYLE<br>D:

                                        would answer a great deal of questions I've had. Case continues.<br>E:

                                        Cooper, conspiratorially.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: Don't worry about Roth. He's nuts.
                                        But Case says that means he's
                                        ideally suited for space travel. Case repositions the map near a much smaller
                                        black hole that is orbiting

                                        we slingshot around
                                        Pantagruel to reach the ice planet. This is the period in which we'll lose time.
                                        Lose time?<br>E:

                                        flatten onto a sheet that
                                        bends, revealing the curvature of gravity.<br>C: ROTH<br>D: High speed or high
                                        gravity both slow down time,

                                        will take us only a few days.
                                        But far more time will be passing back home. The ship's trajectory cuts through
                                        the deep gravity well of the

                                        threaded between two black holes. He looks worried.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: I still
                                        think we're making a lot of
                                        assumptions. About the wormhole. About the planet. The critical orbit here is
                                        incredibly dangerous. It's
                                        like walking on the rim of the volcano. Too fast and we get thrown off at close
                                        to the speed of light. Too
                                        slow and we get pulled into the hole and crushed.<br>E: points to map beat<br>C:

                                        BRAND<br>D: I find it hard to
                                        believe that someone would build a wormhole to a planet with water and oxygen
                                        just to lead us to a dead
                                        end.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: I thought you were a scientist, Brand. That sounds more
                                        like a hypothesis.<br>C:
                                        BRAND<br>D: A guess. That's right. We don't have time to wait for conclusive
                                        proof.<br>E: MORE<br>C:
                                        BRAND<br>D: My guess is that the wormhole is there because someone is trying to
                                        help us. The same way we
                                        used to try to help animals when they were threatened with extinction.<br>E:
                                        CONT'D<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Sure.
                                        Till we ran out of food and ate all of them.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: I guess I'm also
                                        assuming that whoever built
                                        the wormhole has a better plan than we did. If I'm wrong, we'll die, same as
                                        we'd die here anyway.<br>E:
                                        annoyed<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: What do you think, Roth? Roth leans forward, studying
                                        the map.<br>C: ROTH<br>D: If
                                        we're guessing, then I'd say Brand's right. The wormhole couldn't exist
                                        naturally. I think it's there for a
                                        reason. That someone is trying to help us. Brand looks satisfied.<br>C:
                                        DOYLE<br>D: So you think we'll have
                                        no problem navigating between two massive black holes to a tiny planet?<br>C:
                                        ROTH<br>D: I think we'll
                                        probably be killed. I said I thought there was a plan. Not that the plan was for
                                        us to find a planet like
                                        Earth to save a handful of people. Birds don't learn to fly just so that they
                                        can find another egg and crawl
                                        back into it.<br>E: off his look shakes head<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: If that's not the
                                        plan, then what are we
                                        supposed to be doing out there?<br>C: ROTH<br>D: To keep moving. Seeking.
                                        Learning.<br>E: shrugs<br>C: But I
                                        don't know.<br>D: We don't understand how they built the wormhole. What makes
                                        you think we could understand
                                        their plan, either? Doyle gives up -- Roth is impossible. Cooper looks at the

                                        thought I was going to get to enjoy your company all the way to Mars. Tars hands

                                        heavy for the rocket stage. They
                                        have another one waiting for me in orbit. Tars turns his back to Cooper. Two

                                        by nuclear engines. But the most dangerous thing onboard is the three pounds of
                                        organic material in your

                                        Tars could build the colony
                                        without us. You wouldn't need to bring food or oxygen.<br>C: CASE<br>D: Because

                                        at surviving because
                                        evolution gave you magical thinking -the idea that your relationships mean
                                        something. You can't explain the
                                        feelings, so you think of them as irrational. But they're not. They're
                                        programming.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C:

                                        to know the last thing you will see? Cooper hesitates.<br>N: Case senses the

                                        certain. Cooper looks away, overcome for a second with emotion. Case watches
                                        him, gauging his mood, whether
                                        he has said too much. INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE Cooper begins
                                        recording a message.<br>E:

                                        happens, I just wanted to say... I love you boys. And I hope whatever your lives

                                        Erases the message. Stands to leave. As he steps to the door he notices Brand
                                        watching him through the

                                        Cooper smiles, grateful for this small kindness. I know.<br>C: COOPER<br>D:

                                        black hole system. The ice
                                        planet looks precariously balanced, orbiting the smaller black hole.<br>C:

                                        surface of the sun, either.
                                        Black holes are a more stable supply of power than stars in many ways.<br>C:

                                        black holes orbiting each
                                        other. EXT. LAGRANGE POINT, SPACE Behind the ship, the sun is a distant light,

                                        drifts in space. A signal light

                                        wormhole. Tars detaches his legs in order to take up less space during transit.
                                        Then he tethers himself to
                                        the hull wall. Case is the last to join them. He detaches a small control module

                                        pulls himself into the outer hull and seals the passageway. Case presses a

                                        slides gently, silently, through the wormhole. The quiet is eery. Suddenly, a
                                        point of distortion appears in
                                        the hull next to Cooper. It looks like someone is pushing against the hull of
                                        the ship with a giant
                                        finger.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Something's happening to the hull over here.<br>C:

                                        your display is telling you but something is happening over here. Suddenly,
                                        along the hull, Doyle speaks up,
                                        panicked.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: I've got a problem over here, too. Doyle is watching
                                        a separate distortion move
                                        across the inner wall of the ship. This one seems to be TWISTING the material of
                                        the hull. Suddenly, the
                                        point in front of Cooper detaches itself from the outer wall and moves through
                                        the space in front of him,
                                        bending the empty space itself, distorting the ship behind it like a
                                        sphere-shaped magnifying glass.<br>C:
                                        DOYLE<br>D: It's not the hull... it's inside the ship... it's...<br>E:

                                        could be gravitational turbulence. The twisting sphere in front of Doyle begins
                                        to grow.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D:
                                        It's getting bigger. Doyle puts up his hand to defend himself. The sphere
                                        absorbs it, twisting Doyle's hand.
                                        Doyle CRIES OUT. His hand is twisted completely around, impossibly mangled. But
                                        Doyle, hyperventilating,
                                        isn't in any pain.<br>C: ROTH<br>D: It's not bending your hand. It's bending the

                                        sphere begins to pass through Doyle's body. freaking out.<br>N: Doyle is The
                                        sphere in front of Cooper makes
                                        contact with him, also. He holds his breath as it touches him, squeezing and
                                        distorting his body.<br>C:
                                        BRAND<br>D: This isn't turbulence. Look at the way they're moving -- it's like
                                        something's examining us.
                                        Cooper watches the sphere distort his arm, running along the length of it.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: Can you ask it
                                        to stop? Suddenly, as quickly as they appeared, the distortions vanish. For a
                                        moment, the crew is silent,
                                        still spellbound by the encounter. An ALARM sounds. Suddenly, the inner chamber
                                        begins to distort from a
                                        spherical shape to bispherical: two spheres joined. The ship GROANS as if it's
                                        being pulled apart.<br>C:
                                        ROTH<br>D: The wormhole is splitting into two paths. Radiation is pouring from
                                        one path to the other.<br>C:
                                        CASE<br>D: Release the second mouth.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: None of our testing
                                        involved opening the ship inside
                                        the wormhole. We have no idea what might happen.<br>C: CASE<br>D: We're going to
                                        find out. Doyle reaches
                                        over to an auxiliary panel and punches in a sequence. After a moment, the hull
                                        cracks open, creating a
                                        channel through which the radiating mouth can escape. The opening in the ship
                                        allows the pressure to begin
                                        to concentrate on one fracture point. The ship SHUDDERS as it's squeezed along
                                        its axis. Case punches in a
                                        code and the ship begins to close again, painstakingly slowly. Finally, the ship
                                        calms as it closes around
                                        the original wormhole.<br>C: CASE<br>D: We're reaching the far end of the
                                        wormhole. Suddenly, the wormhole
                                        mouth begins to grow inside the inner chamber. What was a ball of light spreads
                                        out into a black canvas
                                        studded with points of light -- like looking into the universe through the wrong
                                        end of a telescope. Cooper
                                        presses himself against the wall and holds on as the hull beneath him opens

                                        receives a long garbled update.
                                        Then it shuts down. Cooper drags himself along the hull until he reaches the

                                        by the gravity of the black hole. EXT. ENDURANCE Instead of reversing course,

                                        as he watches the controls -- on the 'volcano' model, the ship is now passing
                                        the crest and spiraling
                                        towards destruction. He has made a tragic mistake.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: Why isn't

                                        hillside. Cooper is drawn to a small mound in the middle of the valley, four
                                        feet high. He takes out a small

                                        digs around a little more, then reaches up and hacks away at the hillside,

                                        unsure what to make of it. A few feet away, Cooper cuts enough of the mound away
                                        to reveal something
                                        flexible -- fabric caked with ice. He scrapes away the snow, revealing a bright
                                        patch of red fabric: It's

                                        looks at the shimmering light of the tiny life-forms trapped in the ice,
                                        mesmerized. Case hammers down with

                                        glow. The microbes are absorbing the x-rays and emitting light. Within seconds,
                                        they are bathed in an

                                        punches into the ice. Cooper looks down -- a great fissure has opened in the ice
                                        beneath them. Case,
                                        wait--<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Case PUNCHES again. Suddenly, with a great BANG, the

                                        falls. For a moment, the only
                                        light he can see is from Case, falling calmly a few yards beneath him. As they
                                        fall, the light from the
                                        microbes trapped in the ice above sweeps across the inside of the cavern,
                                        illuminating the floor of the
                                        massive cavern thousands of feet down. The rock formations they saw on the
                                        surface are actually the tip of a
                                        mountain range extending into the distance, disappearing into the ice above as
                                        if it were cloud cover. The
                                        base of the mountains is covered in a thick jungle-like foliage that runs into a
                                        perfectly-still inland sea.
                                        On the far side of the sea, another mountain range stretches into the distance,

                                        DAY Cooper finds Brand taking samples from the tree-like lifeforms, which are
                                        wildly different from their
                                        counterparts back on Earth, piled in torturous coils, as if frozen in a struggle
                                        to punch through the canopy
                                        to reach the light above.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: This is incredible. The organisms
                                        trapped in the ice above
                                        absorb xrays and emit light. In return, these plants absorb the light and emit
                                        oxygen, which feeds the
                                        animals trapped in the ice. Brand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case.
                                        The transparent wall of the
                                        case magnifies the structure onto the glass automatically. She compares it with
                                        the flecks she collected in
                                        the ice above, fascinated.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Look at this. I think they're the
                                        same organism at a different
                                        stage of the life cycle. It's fractal. No individual cells -the structure
                                        repeats all the way down. Cooper
                                        looks at the sample, then continues scanning the jungle around them,
                                        nervous.<br>E: CONT'D shows him the

                                        soil's been disturbed. So
                                        something's been moving. But I haven't seen anything. Cooper... are you nervous?
                                        Cooper stops scanning the
                                        trees, embarrassed.<br>E: notices his look<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I just think we
                                        should get back to the shelter
                                        before night falls. Overhead, the light from the ice above begins to fade -- the
                                        neutron star must have
                                        orbited out of view. Night is falling.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Relax. If there are any
                                        large organisms here, even
                                        predatory ones, they're not going to attack us -they have no idea what we

                                        rushes over it in a torrent.
                                        Cooper catches himself at the last minute, grabbing a thick tree branch with one
                                        hand and, a second later,
                                        Brand with the other as she slides past.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I've got you.

                                        hand illuminates and wrenches itself out of the rock -- it's a limb of a huge

                                        the water. She smiles down at him, a little smug.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: I've got

                                        down into the pool behind them, as if imitating them. Cooper stumbles to his
                                        feet and Brand guides them
                                        backward into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool. INT. CAVE --

                                        stick, basking the cave around them in a soft light. As they watch, horrified,
                                        the pool and the rocks in
                                        front of the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes, as they tumble down the
                                        hill in what appears to be a
                                        battle royal. For a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed.
                                        Then, a three-foot-tall
                                        creature with a dozen legs creeps its way toward the entrance to the cave.
                                        Another follows, and another,
                                        until the cave entrance is full. Cooper looks around the cave, frantic. He picks
                                        up a rock. Brand, scared
                                        but still thinking, takes the rock from his hand and drops it back to the
                                        ground.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: It's
                                        game theory. The best move is always to cooperate at first.<br>C: COOPER<br>D:
                                        By "cooperate" do you mean
                                        let it eat me?<br>C: BRAND<br>D: These organisms have no interest in us. They
                                        survive by photosynthesis. All
                                        they need is light.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Then why are they killing each

                                        But we're outnumbered, Cooper. So unless you have a better idea, I suggest we

                                        BRAND<br>D: It's a colony
                                        organism. It's trying to incorporate you into its structure.<br>C: COOPER<br>D:
                                        I don't want it to
                                        incorporate me.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Don't open your mouth. Why n-<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: As he speaks, the
                                        creature on his chest extends four spindly, pointed feelers and reaches gently
                                        into his mouth. Cooper holds
                                        his breath as the organism taps against his teeth. Its skin has a roughened
                                        texture, as if incomplete, and
                                        it appears to be searching for the same texture on Cooper's skin, without much
                                        luck. Bored, the life-forms
                                        climb back down off of Cooper. The last two creatures link up in an imitation of
                                        Cooper's lower body and
                                        attempt to walk across the room like a human. After a moment, the creatures
                                        tumble to the ground and flail
                                        away. Cooper is still breathing hard as the cave empties and he and Brand are
                                        left alone again. Brand steps
                                        to the edge of the cave and watches, fascinated, as the creatures resume
                                        wrestling and battling each
                                        other.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: They're killing each other.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C:
                                        BRAND<br>D: No. They don't bleed...
                                        they don't die... they're just competing... trying out different shapes, looking
                                        for the best one.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: I'd say they have a long way to go.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: They do this
                                        every night. As they watch,
                                        a two-foot-long creature with one huge claw scuttles along the ground, grabbing
                                        smaller opponents and
                                        smashing them apart, then sorting through the wreckage and adopting some of the
                                        writhing parts as its own.
                                        Something about the movement is endearing, the way it experiments with each
                                        piece -- less like a massacre
                                        and more like an over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set. Suddenly, a
                                        massive, lumbering creature
                                        SMASHES down in front of the claw beast. No match, the smaller creature turns to
                                        scuttle away. Too slow. The
                                        larger organism brings one club-like limb smashing down on top of it. After a
                                        moment, it lifts its claw --
                                        the two animals have become one. The new organism lumbers away through the
                                        jungle, happily snapping its new
                                        claw at larger opponents.<br>E: amazed<br>C: BRAND<br>D: The behavior changes as
                                        the animals get bigger and
                                        bigger. More sophisticated. More calculated. Two of the larger organisms square
                                        off, circling each other,
                                        lights pulsing up and down their bodies in a fierce display.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C:

                                        Brand and Cooper huddle around a small chemical fire they've brought with them.
                                        Brand looks at the sample of
                                        the fractal wildlife in her case. It's moving around, splitting apart,
                                        reforming, trying to find a way
                                        out.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: These creatures are billions of years older than we are.
                                        But they're relatively
                                        primitive. They haven't developed tools, culture, language. Why not?<br>C:
                                        COOPER BRAND<br>D: I don't know.
                                        No one knows how intelligent life began on Earth. But the surface of this planet
                                        has virtually no craters.
                                        No impacts. It's been sheltered by the local black holes.<br>C: COOPER<br>D:
                                        What difference would that
                                        make?<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Maybe not enough has gone wrong here. Maybe bad luck is
                                        the key to intelligent
                                        life.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Murph's Law.<br>E: quietly<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Exactly.

                                        them will push them over the top. Maybe that's part of the plan.<br>C:

                                        might be trying to help us?
                                        Cooper is silent for a moment.<br>N: His mood darkens.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I was
                                        in Denver during the first
                                        year of the famine. I was just a kid. We kept waiting for someone to come help
                                        us. People starved to death
                                        sitting on the ground, waiting for someone to come.<br>E: MORE<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: I only made it because I
                                        realized that nobody was coming to save us. We were on our own. Cooper looks
                                        away.<br>E: CONT'D looks at
                                        her<br>N: The memories are never that far away.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Honestly?
                                        After the things I saw... you
                                        want to know why I don't believe that someone would be trying to help us?
                                        Because I'm not sure we're worth
                                        saving. They sit in silence for a while. EXT. CAVE -- NIGHT Cooper sleeps. the

                                        breath -- the temperature is
                                        well below freezing. The first flickers of light are visible in the ice above.
                                        The creatures are huge now,
                                        forty or fifty feet tall, battling each other more and more slowly. As Brand
                                        watches, the largest of them
                                        beats down his rivals, climbing to the top of the heap. Just as the beast
                                        reaches the top, it freezes, as if
                                        stuck. Above, the ice begins to shine brighter and brighter. Suddenly, the beast
                                        on top breaks apart,
                                        unfurling into planes to catch the light. This is what the contest has been
                                        about -a better place in the
                                        sun. Brand takes it in.<br><br></p>

                                        and laughs at him.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: They're not going to move now, Cooper. They

                                        Roth is looking at the ball, which appears to have been built from layers of
                                        different material. The

                                        radioed home. But they didn't receive a response.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: No one was

                                        exploring the system. It says they
                                        found some kind of... ...The word literally means 'treasure.' Case skims through
                                        the rest of the logs, large

                                        five years with a new technology. They began the experiments upstairs, then they
                                        left again and never
                                        returned.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Where did they go?<br>C: CASE<br>D: I
                                        don't know. They've deleted
                                        their mission plan. There's nothing else.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: I think I know what
                                        the problem is. Doyle is
                                        manipulating the time component of the map, slowing down the passage of time,
                                        reversing it, speeding it up.
                                        Look.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: Doyle speeds up the map until the ice planet is nearly a
                                        blur, speeding in its orbit
                                        around Pantagruel.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: There's a small black hole
                                        moving into the system. Too
                                        small for us to have seen in our survey. It's not going to hit the planet, but
                                        it's going to come close. A
                                        tiny black hole soars through the system. Although it misses the ice planet, it
                                        deflects its orbit by a tiny
                                        degree. After a dozen more orbits, the ice planet dips down close to
                                        Pantagruel's event horizon and is torn
                                        apart. Brand and the others watch as the sequence rewinds and repeats -the
                                        planet is pieced back together
                                        again and ejected, then pulled back in and torn apart. Over and over.<br>E:

                                        plan. Cooper looks at Brand.
                                        She is in disbelief, staring as a lifetime's training and optimism are torn to
                                        pieces.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: But
                                        I don't understand... why are we here? What are we here for? Cooper looks
                                        down.<br>N: Brand's upset is
                                        turning to anger.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: What the hell are we here for? I trained my
                                        whole life to reach this
                                        place. She looks at Cooper, questioning.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C: COOPER<br>D:

                                        maybe we just don't understand it yet. She looks down. She knows he doesn't
                                        believe what he's saying. He's
                                        been right all along -- they're alone. For a tiny moment, all hope is lost.
                                        Suddenly, with a distant RUMBLE,
                                        the building begins SHAKING.<br>E: gentle<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Case, what is

                                        grows more intense, as if the
                                        entire building is being gently shaken.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: It's closer than

                                        slides But instead of falling, it simply hangs Then he realizes the same thing
                                        is happening to them -- his
                                        boots no longer have traction with the ground. After a second everything in the
                                        room is floating an inch off
                                        of the ground.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Quick -- hold onto something. He reaches out
                                        to Brand but it's too late --
                                        suddenly they're no longer floating, they're falling. They're falling up.<br>E:
                                        CONT'D<br>C: DOYLE<br>D:
                                        What the hell is happening? Case doesn't answer -- he's looking up at the
                                        control equipment for the
                                        holographic display, which is GROANING under a load it was never built to
                                        handle. Case grabs Cooper and
                                        Brand and pushes them towards the stairwell as the control panel TEARS free of
                                        the floor and<br>C: CRASHES
                                        towards them.<br>D: Cooper falls into the stairwell -- now they're being pulled
                                        up and sideways through the
                                        stairwell, like an Escher painting. Brand pushes Cooper out of the way as debris
                                        from the control panel
                                        orbits past them back up towards the lab. They try to hang on but the force is
                                        becoming irresistible,
                                        dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards the lab upstairs.
                                        Brand wedges herself
                                        against the railing as objects and debris are SMASHING against the door to the
                                        lab. Doyle is trying to hang
                                        onto the handrail but his grip slips and he CRIES OUT as he falls towards the
                                        door to the lab, SMASHING it
                                        open. Doyle disappears up and into the lab. Cooper slips trying to help Doyle.

                                        underside of the panel. He
                                        dangles, the panel cutting into the meat of his hand, trying to get his
                                        bearings: Roth, Doyle, and
                                        everything that hasn't been bolted down is either pressed against the sphere in
                                        the center of the room or is
                                        orbiting around it. Roth, who is laughing, jubilant, shouts up to him:<br>C:

                                        back to the ground, along with everything else. Brand stumbles in to find Cooper

                                        box. Roth has hooked the box
                                        up to a terminal and it scrolling through the incredibly sophisticated machine
                                        code, trying to parse how it

                                        does but I think it sends a signal out into the bulk. It must tap into the same
                                        technologies that were used

                                        the tiny box.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: But how did the Chinese develop the technology?
                                        This would take decades,
                                        maybe hundreds of years, to create.<br>C: CASE<br>D: Wherever they went, they

                                        devices to save this planet. But they didn't work. Nothing would be strong
                                        enough to weaken a black

                                        missing the bigger picture. The robots had strict mission parameters. They were
                                        told to build a colony and
                                        report back. They tried to. But they failed. Like us they were fixated on this
                                        place. Cooper looks at
                                        Brand.<br>C: ROTH<br>D: They didn't realize they had already found something

                                    <p id=99>Scene 99: INT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT<br>N: Roth follows
                                        Cooper into the lab. Cooper
                                        opens the storage crate. Picks one of the probes at random. Sets it down on the
                                        bench next to Roth. Cooper
                                        begins rigging up a connection between the two.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I'm going to
                                        image the operating code and
                                        the architecture onto the probe's hard drive. It'll be garbled, but it should
                                        give you and me enough to
                                        rebuild it when we get back. Cooper looks at the probe filling up with data. Not
                                        me.<br>C: ROTH<br>D: But
                                        you'll make it work.<br>N: The transfer is complete. Roth hands Cooper the
                                        probe, and takes the black box
                                        himself.<br>C: ROTH<br>D: This is a one-way trip for me. Before Cooper can

                                        way for all of us to leave.<br>C: ROTH<br>D: This is the only way. Keep the

                                        You need to make it home. You're going to need to build more of these. Brand
                                        looks at him,

                                        have to keep exploring. Keep learning. One good idea isn't enough. You'll need
                                        more and more of them just to
                                        survive. Do you understand? Thank you. Go.<br>E: CONT'D nods<br>N: BRAND<br>C:

                                        Brand is looking off into the distance.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Someone's coming.
                                        Cooper looks up. A robotlike
                                        figure is limping through the snowstorm towards them. Cooper raises the rifle.
                                        Finally he makes out the
                                        insignia -- it's Case. Cooper and Doyle run out towards him. They reach Case as
                                        he collapses in the snow.
                                        He's badly injured -- one leg torn off at the knee, one arm mangled. Doyle and
                                        Cooper drag the crippled
                                        robot back into the ship. INT. LANDER -- NIGHT They drag Case into the lander.

                                        wrong.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Where's Brand? She's nowhere to be seen. Cooper looks
                                        out onto the ice. Brand is
                                        heading back out into the snow.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Dammit. If I don't make it
                                        back, just keep going. Get
                                        that thing home. Cooper steps to the door. EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET The
                                        rocket tucks in close behind one
                                        of the moons orbiting the ice planet. The rocket fires to maneuver closer and
                                        closer to the moon's surface
                                        -- the tiny moon doesn't provide enough gravity to attract it. When the rocket
                                        is close enough, Roth
                                        detonates the explosive bolts holding him inside and leaps for the moon's
                                        surface. He scrambles to grab hold
                                        of the craggy surface. Behind him, the rocket smashes apart against the surface.
                                        Roth finally gets a good
                                        hold.<br>E: CONT'D points to probe<br>N: He looks down. Below him, the view is
                                        incredible -- the ice planet
                                        curving into the distance, Gargantua rising over its horizon. Roth looks at the
                                        black box in his
                                        hands.<br><br></p>

                                        time Cooper catches up with her. She is digging in the snow. He takes her arm
                                        but she won't go. She finally
                                        finds what she's looking for -- the sample case. The tiny fractal life-form is
                                        huddled at the bottom. Cooper
                                        shakes his head and turns back to the lander. 109.*<br><br></p>

                                        planet pass by beneath him.
                                        He finally sees the distant peaks of the mountain range as it punctures the ice
                                        near the Chinese camp. For a
                                        moment he enjoys the view -- the distant hulk of Gargantua rising over the
                                        horizon of the shining ice
                                        planet. He takes a final breath and activates the black box. Instantly, the
                                        moon's gravity is magnified a
                                        hundred million times over. Roth is instantly crushed as the moon collapses
                                        around him into a tiny

                                        the lander. Suddenly, the ground beneath them begins to RUMBLE. Cooper turns
                                        back. A mile back the ground
                                        begins to tear apart, heaving massive chunks of ice and rock into the sky.
                                        Roth's moon is racing overhead,

                                        begins to detach from the

                                        spins away from the ship and
                                        back down toward Pantagruel. Cooper SMASHES Liu from behind. The robot tumbles
                                        to the ground, the fight gone
                                        out of him. Cooper and Doyle roll the robot over and Cooper reaches for his

                                        happen. We'll lose more time... too much... The boosters are no match for the
                                        deadly pull of the black hole
                                        below them. On the ship's guidance, they watch, helpless, as the ship climbs
                                        back up the volcano rim towards

                                        down into the deep gravity
                                        well around the hole. As they watch, trapped, decades begin to play out in the
                                        system above them. They watch
                                        as the ice planet whirls around them, orbiting the black hole dozens of
                                        times.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: We're

                                        Nothing has prepared them for the
                                        reality: The ice planet is SMASHED apart with stunning violence. Brand looks at

                                        Murph looks at the camera for a long beat, clearly unsure about this. Hello,

                                        Almost every compartment has
                                        been opened and emptied -- debris is swirling through the compartment. Brand
                                        walks in. They sit in silence
                                        for a moment. When Cooper speaks, it's clear his sadness has faded to a gallows

                                        BRAND<br>D: Maybe that's enough. He turns away from her.<br>N: She takes his
                                        shoulder. She pulls him into a
                                        kiss. His surprise disappears and he pulls her to him, kissing her back. Their
                                        surroundings forgotten, they
                                        drift. She LAUGHS gently as they bump into a wall and he pushes off of it,
                                        sending them spinning back into
                                        the center of the cabin. She pulls his shirt off and it hangs in space. In
                                        moments, the cabin is filling
                                        with discarded clothes, different colors and shapes, like a ticker tape parade.
                                        In the center of the cabin,
                                        Brand and Cooper make love.<br><br></p>

                                        in the cabin. Suddenly, Doyle's voice calls out from the other cabin.<br>C:
                                        DOYLE<br>D: It's happening...
                                        it's happening again... Get up here... Cooper wakes, careful not to disturb
                                        Brand. He plucks his shirt from
                                        the floating laundry pile and pulls it on.<br>E: O.S.<br><br></p>
                                    <p id=117>Scene 117: INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE<br>N: Cooper hauls himself up
                                        into the upper cabin.
                                        standing in the middle of the chamber. Doyle is<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: They just
                                        appeared. A sphere of
                                        distortion, like the one they encountered in the first wormhole, is directly in
                                        front of Doyle, hovering at
                                        a point in the middle of the cabin. Doyle points a finger gently at the sphere,
                                        which grows in response.
                                        Brand pulls herself into the cabin. Several more points appear, as if they've
                                        been summoned by the first.
                                        Some of the points twist, some of them spin, and some of them are
                                        motionless.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: I think
                                        these are the creatures that built the wormhole. One of them begins to move
                                        closer to Cooper.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: This thing is made of... gravity?<br>C: BRAND<br>D: No. I don't
                                        think it's in our universe at
                                        all. I think it lives in the bulk -- the space that the wormholes traverse. And
                                        it can only interact with us
                                        using gravity. The shape playfully grows around Cooper's hand, bending the space
                                        it's in, stretching the
                                        skin. Doyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body, coming to
                                        rest in the middle and bending
                                        his entire torso like a fun house mirror. Suddenly, the sphere wrapped around
                                        Cooper's hand begins moving,
                                        tugging him gently through the cabin. In the next moment, all three of them are
                                        being propelled through the
                                        cabin. It's a magical moment -- a communion, a dance between creatures on either
                                        side of a massive,
                                        invisible wall. Doyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled
                                        around the room.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: Can we communicate with them?<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Where would we even
                                        start?<br>N: Maybe-- She
                                        pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and tears the bag open,
                                        releasing a cloud of the tiny
                                        shining globes into the air. For a moment, nothing happens. Then, the
                                        distortions begin moving through the
                                        bearings, shifting them, rearranging them into patterns in the air. First, they
                                        rearrange the ball bearings
                                        into clusters, then shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around
                                        a medium-sized star.<br>C:
                                        DOYLE<br>D: That's our solar system. After a moment the ball bearings break
                                        apart again and rearrange into a
                                        larger, more complicated system -- Gargantua, Pantagruel, and the ice planet.
                                        Finally, the bearings compress
                                        to a two-dimensional sheet. Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits
                                        around the stars and then
                                        pushes up, off of the sheet, into an umbrella shaped space that rises up from
                                        the sheet.<br>C: COOPER<br>D:
                                        What is that? Brand looks at the tiny particle, floating alone above its
                                        universe.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: That's

                                        close in on something in the darkness: a tiny point of light. As they grow
                                        closer, they realize that it's an
                                        opening. They are inside a massive, hollow sphere. They have been the entire

                                        through the opening at the crown of the sphere. Below them is an astonishing
                                        sight: Our entire universe,
                                        compressed into a flattened disc, like a floor of stars. They are hovering above

                                        habitable by humans -- and are
                                        following Tars through the massive facility.<br>E: deadpan<br>C: TARS<br>D: I

                                        times before I hit the second wormhole. Then I drifted until I found this place.
                                        Cooper looks around. The

                                        is what the Chinese were
                                        protecting. How they could have built all this in just a handful of years.<br>E:

                                        for three hundred years.
                                        Brand looks around at the massive facility.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Time. That's what
                                        the bulk beings wanted to
                                        give us. That was the treasure the Chinese found. Enough time to let us save
                                        ourselves. Brand looks around.
                                        The facility is massive. She sets the specimen case down on a table. Even the
                                        tiny creature seems in awe of
                                        the place. INT. LABORATORY, SPACE STATION Tars shows them a prototype for the
                                        gravity machine. It is tiny --
                                        increasing G around two spheres that attract each other with a tiny force.<br>C:

                                        catalogued almost everything they had built here.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Must have
                                        taken you a while.<br>C:
                                        TARS<br>D: One hundred and fifty-seven years. Cooper shakes his head in
                                        disbelief.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: How
                                        are they keeping the lights on in this thing? Tars, in answer, points to a far
                                        door. Follow me.<br>C:

                                        shudders with the energy
                                        contained within it. The whole room HUMS with power. Tars pulls up a display
                                        showing the inside of the
                                        shell: A tiny black hole spins, spewing out massive amounts of power.<br>C:

                                        them on. EXT. HANGAR, SPACE
                                        STATION Tars leads them past an incredibly sleek fleet of spacecraft. Cooper
                                        starts to stop, but Tars
                                        doesn't slow down. INT. SIMULATION ROOM In the center of the room is a giant
                                        holographic globe of the Earth,
                                        perfect down to the tiniest detail. It's a map?<br>C: COOPER TARS<br>D: No. Not
                                        a map. This is a simulation
                                        of the Earth. A perfect simulation. Tars touches the control panel. The map
                                        zooms in over Europe. Down onto

                                        TARS<br>D: They tested each of the
                                        technologies hundreds of times, trying to find the one that would cause the
                                        least damage and still allow us
                                        to leave Earth. Suddenly, the map lights up with atomic explosions in every
                                        city. The sequence stops,
                                        rewinds. This time, sped up, the Earth seems to be drying up -- great swaths of
                                        desert grow across Europe
                                        and Asia. Massive circular ships are constructed all over the face of the

                                        on the ice planet, allowing
                                        the entire human population to escape. At a given moment, the gravity of the
                                        Earth is dropped to nothing and

                                        save us?<br>N: Why didn't Brand is staring at the massive map.<br>C: BRAND<br>D:
                                        Because they were too late.
                                        By the time they found this place, the people who sent them were dead. They were
                                        unable to fulfill their
                                        mission. Tars points to the next room.<br>C: TARS<br>D: That was the final
                                        problem they tried to solve. Tars
                                        moves on. EXT. PLATFORM, SPACE STATION Above them, the blackness of the sky is
                                        punctuated with hundreds of
                                        crystal shapes, faintly leaking starlight: Wormholes.<br>N: Brand looks up at
                                        them, entranced.<br>C:
                                        BRAND<br>D: Where do they lead?<br>N: Tars looks at an illuminated schematic on
                                        one wall, mapping some of
                                        the wormholes.<br>C: TARS<br>D: There are millions of them, connecting virtually
                                        every planetary system in
                                        the universe. There are thousands in our galaxy alone. But the Chinese stopped
                                        mapping them when they found
                                        what they were looking for. Tars walks further.<br>N: He stops. The platform in
                                        front of them is dominated
                                        by a gigantic version of the black box that Roth found on the ice planet,
                                        connected to a massive power
                                        array, and pointing into the dark space above the sphere. 133.*<br>C: TARS<br>D:
                                        This was their final
                                        creation. They had to capture the mini black hole just to have enough power to
                                        try it. Several miles above
                                        the black box, one of the wormholes glows far brighter than the others,
                                        crackling with radiation.<br>E:
                                        CONT'D<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: What does it do? Cooper steps forward. Runs a hand on
                                        the cold, strange material
                                        the antenna is made out of. He knows exactly what it does.<br>C: COOPER<br>D:
                                        They weren't interested in the
                                        other wormholes because their mission was to return home. That one leads back to
                                        Earth. The Earth they were
                                        told to return to. Tars walks to the controls for the device.<br>C: BRAND<br>D:
                                        But that's impossible...
                                        Tars turns away from the machine.<br>C: TARS<br>D: It was only used once. The
                                        Chinese team attempted to
                                        travel back in time, to Earth just a few years after they had left.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: Did they make
                                        it?<br>C: TARS I don't know.<br>D: Doyle looks back to Cooper.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D:
                                        Do you really think it
                                        works? Cooper looks up at the machine, suddenly determined.<br>C: COOPER<br>D:
                                        We're going to find out.
                                        Cooper walks out of the room.<br>N: Brand follows him. 134.*<br><br></p>

                                        would have suddenly discovered
                                        all of these incredible technologies. But they never made it. You can't go back,
                                        Cooper. You can slow things
                                        down, but you can't ever go back. Our home is gone. You listened to all of those
                                        messages from your family.
                                        If you had made it back, we would already know. There would already be some
                                        evidence. Cooper looks at the

                                        Roth was right, Cooper. We
                                        have to keep going. Keep exploring. We have an obligation to try to survive.
                                        From here we could find a

                                        at Murph. Murph looks around the place. There is nothing left to salvage. He

                                        mainframe that survived the looting. He hooks the probe up to it. After a

                                        Murph switches off the screen. He stands. Begins to leave without the probe.

                                        and is tweaking values on it, trying to decrypt the contents. His WIFE, several

                                        Suddenly, the screen begins filling
                                        with data. Murph stares at it, wide eyed. CUT TO: INT.<br>N: BARN -- NIGHT

                                        double checks it, then

                                        is growing stronger -- the entire structure is buckling. Emily, now 18, backs

                                        towards the wreckage of the barn, chunky tires plowing up the soil. Finally, the

                                        Mother Nature has just about wiped the slate clean. Most of the vegetation is
                                        gone, and unchecked winds
                                        sweep across the barren plains. Patches of ice lie think on the ground, as if a
                                        heavy snow has come and

                                        He takes a cautious look
                                        around. He is holding the fractal life in its small container. The clouds are
                                        threatening, but the weather
                                        looks calm enough right here. Cooper starts to walk.<br><br></p>

                                        of his kitchen. Two walls are
                                        missing and the rest is collapsed in a heap. But he can still see where he used
                                        to feed his kids breakfast.
                                        He has kept his promise. Several hundred years too late. Cooper hunkers down,
                                        staring at the space where his
                                        kids used to be. Rainwater covers the ancient formica. It has taken him years to
                                        finally reach this place.
                                        He has had plenty of time to come to grips with what he might find. But nothing
                                        has prepared him for this:

                                        hits. Unchecked by trees or vegetation, the wind rockets through the house,
                                        blasting Cooper and pelting
                                        what's left of the structure with fist-sized hail. Cooper takes shelter against

                                        going to have to sit this one out -- the hail and winds are the brutal
                                        descendants of the weather he knew.
                                        They'll finish him off if he steps back outside. As he watches, the pool of

                                        freezes over in seconds.<br><br></p>

                                        against the wall. The storm
                                        is still raging outside. He is freezing to death. He has to move now or he will
                                        die. He pulls the hood tight
                                        around his face and stumbles outside.<br><br></p>

                                        to find his way, but the ship has been consumed by the blizzard. He stumbles to
                                        the ground, dropping the
                                        glass case with the fractal wildlife in it. The case shatters. Cooper tries to
                                        stand back up, but his
                                        strength is dwindling. 145.* As he watches, the fractal wildlife creeps
                                        tentatively out of its broken
                                        habitat. It forms together against the cold. After a moment, it burrows into the
                                        ice. As it does, the ice
                                        glows faintly. It seems to be right at home. Cooper laughs, glimpsing the
                                        outline of a plan. Was this what
                                        the beings who made the wormhole intended all along? Cooper suddenly spots the
                                        outline of the ship through
                                        the driving snow. He stumbles back up to his feet and struggles a few more
                                        steps, then stumbles again,
                                        spent. Finally, he sits down in the snow to die. As his senses flicker in and
                                        out, he is struck with
                                        memories of his boys, so vivid he reaches out for them, crawling forward in the
                                        snow. He stops, and laughs,
                                        remembering what Case told him about what happens when humans die. He struggles
                                        to his feet and stumbles a
                                        few more feet, eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship. Cooper takes

                                        Cooper. I wrote a paper on it when I was a boy. And I think we found something
                                        you'll really enjoy. EXT.
                                        CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- DAY Corn blows in an artificial breeze. A red
                                        tractor makes its way through the
                                        field, which curves gently up in the distance.<br>E: CONT'D big smile<br>C:
                                        ADMINISTRATOR<br>D: The machines
                                        do most of the work, of course, but we were able to get you a few acres. You're
                                        going to be a farmer again.
                                        After a moment, the tractor stops. Cooper climbs down from the seat. Looks at
                                        the front steering linkage,
                                        which is jammed with an errant tree branch. He wipes his forehead and begins
                                        working the branch out of the
                                        machine. He looks miserable. A robot, a similar unit to Tars, walks over. a
                                        bottle of water. Cooper accepts
                                        it.<br>E: V.O.<br>N: Offers Cooper<br><br></p>

                                        hangar floor. Below him, bright young things in uniforms climb into
                                        sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to

                                    <p id=138>Scene 138: EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, COOPER STATION<br>N: Cooper sits in the
                                        stands, listening to the
                                        familiar crack of the bat as an intramural team from the university practices.
                                        Cooper watches. He looks
                                        bored. The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. For a second, the catcher shuffles
                                        back and forth, trying to get
                                        himself into position. But the ball never returns. The catcher YELLS out a
                                        warning. Above, the ball begins
                                        to slowly fall up, not down, toward the town center above. After a second, the
                                        ball smashes through a
                                        skylight of a building high above them. Cooper watches as the kid rounds the
                                        bases, laughing.<br><br></p>

                                        rotates lazily out of alignment with the local star, casting the inside of the

                                        looking over one of the
                                        sleeklooking spacecraft. He packs up his tools and heads out. After a moment,
                                        two figures pick their way
                                        across the hangar floor, sticking to the shadows. As they reach the first ship
                                        in the line, we get a better
                                        look. It's Cooper and his robot pal. The robot is wearing a baseball cap and
                                        carrying a toolbox. Cooper
                                        gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with a click against the
                                        mirror-like floor. Cooper shakes
                                        his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his finger to his lips. The robot
                                        nods, bashful. Cooper waves a
                                        small handheld computer near the skin of the ship until it lights up. Then he
                                        punches in a few codes.
                                        Nothing happens. He punches in a few more. Suddenly, the hatch opens with a
                                        HISS.<br><br></p>

                                        ship. Looks over the controls.
                                        The robot straps himself in next to him. Cooper looks up through the windows.
                                        The inky black void of space
                                        beckons. Cooper smiles and reaches for the controls.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Where do

                                                    what we leave behind for future generations. There are echoes of

                                                    save mankind. Questions of relative time may scramble the brain, but
                                                    it’s done with the utmost sincerity and not without humour, which is
                                                    a welcome touch. It’s not an action film, certainly not a
                                                    single-minded one like Gravity, so that shouldn’t be expected, but

                                                    contemplate, and when it concentrates on its profound examination of

                                                    with immense skill, yet it never quite achieves that moment of
                                                    transcendence that it seems to threaten for the first two
                                                    hours.<br><br>There’s plenty of room for trimming in its much too
                                                    generous running time, and <span id="director">Nolan</span> throws
                                                    into the mix the kinds of characters and plot developments you might
                                                    expect from lesser filmmakers, undoing a lot of good work in a final
                                                    hour that at times can be sluggish and ponderous.<br><br>So the
                                                    year’s most anticipated film has turned out to be a good one, at
                                                    times a very good one. But in the end does it really amount to much
                                                    more than you might find in the very best episodes of Star

                                                    term "science fiction" was coined to represent. It presents a viable
                                                    future in which space travel, while possible, is dangerous and
                                                    uncertain. Starships aren't zipping from planet to planet. Space

                                                    black hole and there's even a little bit about the relationship

                                                    such expectations will be disappointed. It's more along the lines of

                                                    and Gravity in that it acknowledges science rather than ignoring the

                                                    it goes far afield. There's heroism, a la The Right Stuff. It's also
                                                    a warmer, more emotional experience - less stately and abstruse. In

                                                    This is big. It’s huge. We don’t make movies like this anymore — we
                                                    hardly ever did. I’m not talking about big in the sense of budget or
                                                    even big like epic. We do that plenty: spend the GDP of a small
                                                    nation to make men in capes fly or monsters stomp or toys sing. I’m
                                                    talking big when it comes to ideas. Big when it comes to optimism.

                                                    is dreary and depressing. Postapocalyptic and apprehensive. We

                                                    and viscerally. It is full of stirring notions of what humanity
                                                    might be capable of, and follows through with the breathtaking

                                                    necessarily follows if we chase those possibilities instead of
                                                    ignoring them. It is full of enormous risk-taking in the quest for
                                                    something bigger and better for all of us. It is full of hope for

                                                    the near future, we are witnessing a slow collapse of nature, a

                                                    (and presumably every other living thing, too). And it’s not only

                                                    of wonder and excitement can be rustled up by someone with the

                                                    of reason to hope anyway. But we do actually have to try.

                                                    expansive, thought-provoking experiences wrapped up in cinema.
                                                    Perhaps his aims are too ambitious at times, but you can never
                                                    accuse him of making an everyday film. He always shoots for the moon
                                                    (or better yet a wormhole) and so his projects are ultimately better
                                                    than most, even if they miss the target a bit. The reason being,
                                                    <span id="movie">Interstellar</span> is still full of enough
                                                    questions and concepts to leave us thinking for a good long time
                                                    after we leave the theater.<br><br>Although approximately 2 hours

                                                    starts on a world that is certainly earth but strangely dystopian
                                                    compared to the planet that we know and love. Reminiscent of When
                                                    Harry Met Sally or something, old folks speak of the way the world
                                                    was when the dust first hit and the corn crops had to be burned. Not
                                                    much explanation is given but it is what it is.<br><br>This is the
                                                    climate that the engineer-turned-farmer Coop (Matthew McConaughey)
                                                    has to raise his two kids after his wife passed away. They are good
                                                    kids for the most part. <span id="character">Murph</span> blames a
                                                    so-called “ghost” for accidents that happen around the house and her
                                                    brother teases her some. But they hardly complain about this life
                                                    they have they; just push forward.<br><br>However, their father has
                                                    always been an explorer at heart, a pilot who never got to truly
                                                    test the vast seas of space or spread out his wings fully. That
                                                    changes when he and his daughter come across an old relic from the
                                                    past. No, it’s not a monolith but something far more human. He
                                                    somewhat reluctantly teams up with his old professor Brandt (Sir
                                                    Michael Caine) and the professor’s daughter Amelia(Anne Hathaway) in
                                                    a major undertaking.<br><br>They want Coop to pilot a mission to a
                                                    wormhole which is just out of humanity’s reach. It was seemingly
                                                    miraculously gifted to the human race by some unknown third person.
                                                    This is their chance to A: find a new planet for a mass exodus or B:
                                                    restart a colony on a far away destination. The first option is far
                                                    less grim. Coop takes the mission in the hopes of saving his kids,
                                                    but he knows the ramifications. Since time is all relative he does
                                                    not know when he is coming back. He does not even know what he will
                                                    find or if he will be successful. He heads off as an angry <span

                                                    her life.<br><br>In a match cut of his own, <span

                                                    outer reaches of the galaxy. The real adventure has begun. The
                                                    mission is clear. Save humanity from most certain extinction. It
                                                    does not make it easier however that messages are constantly being
                                                    relayed from earth. Coop and his three colleagues set up a plan of
                                                    action. Their first target is a water covered environment that looks
                                                    promising. Not so. Next, Coop overrules Brandt and they head to a
                                                    desolate world that a previous explorer had labeled as inhabitable.
                                                    To put it bluntly, he lied and he was not the only one.<br><br>Now

                                                    an especially impactful scene, a still ageless Coop watches

                                                    forward to try and find a solution. But the answers are few and far

                                                    the crew of the Endurance. In one final act of selfless valor Coop
                                                    heads into a black hole and thus begins his own mind-blowing leg of
                                                    his space odyssey. Some connections are made and when all the pieces
                                                    are put together all that really matters is his inextinguishable
                                                    love and family. In the end, Coop spends a nice moment with his
                                                    daughter under very different circumstances. Together they saved the

                                                    Amelia Brand claims, “Love is the one thing that transcends time and
                                                    space.” There are still scientific questions left to be debated for
                                                    years to come, but we know that love is one thing that is forever
                                                    true.<br><br>There are obviously numerous comparisons that can be
                                                    made between <span id="movie">Interstellar</span> and 2001. I would
                                                    rather focus on the differences very briefly. In <span
                                                        id="director">Nolan</span>’s film, A.I. is actually useful and
                                                    more reliable and kind than humanity itself. It is Man who lies,
                                                    cheats and reverts to animalistic behavior all in the name of
                                                    survival. <span id="movie">Interstellar</span> has a lot of
                                                    scientific theory behind it (which I will acknowledge I do not know
                                                    the ins and outs of), however, it also has a very human component.
                                                    It is grounded on earth with Coop’s kids.<br><br>The visuals in
                                                    <span id="movie">Interstellar</span> are often breathtaking but we
                                                    would probably expect that for such an ambitious space saga. What I
                                                    really took out of this film was the score and juxtaposition of
                                                    sound. Hans Zimmer’s compositions were full of pounding organs that
                                                    somehow fit the mood with their majestic and still austere sound.
                                                    Furthermore, this film had a lot of dialogue and tense moments of
                                                    noise, however, when we are outside the spacecraft it is almost
                                                    completely silent reminding us of the reality of space. It is more
                                                    often than not a vast, silent unknown.<br><br>I am reminded of when
                                                    Coop explains to his daughter why she was named after <span
                                                        id="character">Murph</span>y’s Law which seems to be bad. He
                                                    replies that “<span id="character">Murph</span>y’s law doesn’t mean
                                                    that something bad will happen. It means that whatever can happen,
                                                    will happen.” And that was good enough for Coop and his late wife.
                                                    In some ways I think these words can be used to describe <span
                                                        id="movie">Interstellar</span>. With <span
                                                        id="director">Nolan</span>, there is the potential that whatever
                                                    can happen, will. There is excitement and magic in that, even if it
                                                    sometimes overshoots its bounds. It’s not necessarily a bad thing
                                                    and that’s good enough for me.<br><br>

                                                    process all this information. Because I have a lot of questions. Is
                                                    it possible that some things don't add up? Of course, big chunks
                                                    were left to our imagination. That way it always adds up. You might
                                                    not like the robots at first, but give them a chance. They are
                                                    awesome.

                                                    disadvantage about a science-fiction film is that they are mostly
                                                    based on a premise that defies common sense and may not even be
                                                    possible. Much like Modern Physics and the theories of relativity
                                                    that defy what we perceive as common sense. But it would be ignorant
                                                    to say that they aren't true and it would be ignorant to say that

                                                    fiction.<br><br><br>If I were to be completely frank, I would say
                                                    <span id="movie">Interstellar</span> is pretty much another 2001: A
                                                    Space Odyssey without the mind melting finale it gives. It is a
                                                    captivating film with visual effects to kill for, a lot of which is
                                                    shot in IMAX, capturing beautifully the horror of the cosmos. Much
                                                    like 2001, it talks about man's place in the universe and makes a
                                                    solid statement at that towards the climax. It tries to juxtapose
                                                    emotional, scientific, rational and survival instincts, each of
                                                    equal significance and asks the characters to choose between them.
                                                    It looks like a pretty easy choice to the viewers but the film shows
                                                    how reality is far more different.<br><br>At a rudimentary level,
                                                    <span id="movie">Interstellar</span> is a lot of science but a lot
                                                    more of fiction. It addresses paradoxes of time and space but leaves
                                                    much to the 'magic' of a five dimensional world. So let's leave the
                                                    science to the explanations of the films in documentaries and talk
                                                    of it as just a film; and not just any film, n 'All Time Great'
                                                    film.<br><br>Look at Matthew McConaughey, the male protagonist <span
                                                        id="character">Cooper</span>, who pilots a spaceship carrying a
                                                    crew to a different galaxy via a wormhole created by some 'higher
                                                    beings' to search for a planet where the inhabitants of a dying
                                                    earth can survive and flourish. McConaughey is one actor who takes
                                                    his role seriously enough to give it his everything. Similar is
                                                    <span id="character">Cooper</span>'s character and so they tune in
                                                    nicely. Another notable performance comes from Michael Caine (but of
                                                    course) who plays Professor Brand, a physicist trying to device a
                                                    theory in order to make it possible for all the earth people to
                                                    reach the new planet. Caine, undoubtedly, looks intelligent enough
                                                    to pull this through. Anne Hathaway as <span

                                                    daughter has been given less work than she can actually take. A
                                                    particularly solid character is that of <span

                                                    amount of emotional mix into the story. All this coupled with time
                                                    dilation and black holes makes for one hell of a movie to
                                                    watch.<br><br>The best thing about <span
                                                        id="movie">Interstellar</span> is that it is intelligent and
                                                    silent at the same time. Of course when you incorporate actual
                                                    science in a movie, you throw in some exposition then and now into
                                                    the scenes but look at those serenic pauses that it provides you to
                                                    let the reality of the havocs inside the ship sink into the quiet of
                                                    the outer space. The movie even succeeds at finding reasonable
                                                    importance to the melodrama it throws at some points which I
                                                    initially hated but later pardoned; because the overall excitement
                                                    and thrill of the movie is awesome enough to complete it without any
                                                    higher morality or supernatural phenomenon or any brain frying
                                                    ending.
