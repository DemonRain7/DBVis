                                                    sci-fi epic that’s two parts magnificence to one part frustration.

                                                    discovered near Saturn, and to whatever lies beyond that. That’s all
                                                    you really need to know, because from this point in there are many

                                                    what we leave behind for future generations. There are echoes of
                                                    2001 in its silent, balletic space sequences, as well as in some of

                                                    unleashes in the later stages.<br><br>A lot of the time it’s hard
                                                    science, as actual rocket scientists come up with plans for how to
                                                    save mankind. Questions of relative time may scramble the brain, but
                                                    it’s done with the utmost sincerity and not without humour, which is
                                                    a welcome touch. It’s not an action film, certainly not a
                                                    single-minded one like Gravity, so that shouldn’t be expected, but
                                                    when <span id="director">Nolan</span> does throw some in, he runs
                                                    with ideas and visuals that make for jaw-dropping

                                                    the scale of what we’re dealing with here can be difficult to
                                                    contemplate, and when it concentrates on its profound examination of
                                                    humanity, it approaches brilliance.<br><br><br>In most regards, this
                                                    is exactly what we should be demanding from our blockbusters. It’s
                                                    conceived with intelligence and far-reaching intent and executed
                                                    with immense skill, yet it never quite achieves that moment of
                                                    transcendence that it seems to threaten for the first two
                                                    hours.<br><br>There’s plenty of room for trimming in its much too
                                                    generous running time, and <span id="director">Nolan</span> throws
                                                    into the mix the kinds of characters and plot developments you might
                                                    expect from lesser filmmakers, undoing a lot of good work in a final
                                                    hour that at times can be sluggish and ponderous.<br><br>So the
                                                    year’s most anticipated film has turned out to be a good one, at
                                                    times a very good one. But in the end does it really amount to much
                                                    more than you might find in the very best episodes of Star

                                                    term "science fiction" was coined to represent. It presents a viable
                                                    future in which space travel, while possible, is dangerous and
                                                    uncertain. Starships aren't zipping from planet to planet. Space

                                                    across long distances uses the dangerous and unpredictable method of
                                                    entering a wormhole, not engaging Warp One or making the jump to
                                                    hyperspace. Time dilation comes into effect in the presence of a
                                                    black hole and there's even a little bit about the relationship
                                                    between quantum mechanics and relativity. This isn't Star Wars, Star

                                                    such expectations will be disappointed. It's more along the lines of
                                                    recent movies like Contact (which also starred Matthew McConaughey)
                                                    and Gravity in that it acknowledges science rather than ignoring the
                                                    rules of reality as we understand them.<br><br>It will be difficult

                                                    This is big. It’s huge. We don’t make movies like this anymore — we
                                                    hardly ever did. I’m not talking about big in the sense of budget or
                                                    even big like epic. We do that plenty: spend the GDP of a small
                                                    nation to make men in capes fly or monsters stomp or toys sing. I’m
                                                    talking big when it comes to ideas. Big when it comes to optimism.

                                                    is dreary and depressing. Postapocalyptic and apprehensive. We

                                                    and viscerally. It is full of stirring notions of what humanity

                                                    necessarily follows if we chase those possibilities instead of
                                                    ignoring them. It is full of enormous risk-taking in the quest for
                                                    something bigger and better for all of us. It is full of hope for

                                                    expansive, thought-provoking experiences wrapped up in cinema.
                                                    Perhaps his aims are too ambitious at times, but you can never
                                                    accuse him of making an everyday film. He always shoots for the moon
                                                    (or better yet a wormhole) and so his projects are ultimately better
                                                    than most, even if they miss the target a bit. The reason being,

                                                    starts on a world that is certainly earth but strangely dystopian
                                                    compared to the planet that we know and love. Reminiscent of When
                                                    Harry Met Sally or something, old folks speak of the way the world
                                                    was when the dust first hit and the corn crops had to be burned. Not
                                                    much explanation is given but it is what it is.<br><br>This is the
                                                    climate that the engineer-turned-farmer Coop (Matthew McConaughey)
                                                    has to raise his two kids after his wife passed away. They are good
                                                    kids for the most part. <span id="character">Murph</span> blames a

                                                    brother teases her some. But they hardly complain about this life
                                                    they have they; just push forward.<br><br>However, their father has
                                                    always been an explorer at heart, a pilot who never got to truly
                                                    test the vast seas of space or spread out his wings fully. That
                                                    changes when he and his daughter come across an old relic from the
                                                    past. No, it’s not a monolith but something far more human. He
                                                    somewhat reluctantly teams up with his old professor Brandt (Sir
                                                    Michael Caine) and the professor’s daughter Amelia(Anne Hathaway) in
                                                    a major undertaking.<br><br>They want Coop to pilot a mission to a
                                                    wormhole which is just out of humanity’s reach. It was seemingly
                                                    miraculously gifted to the human race by some unknown third person.
                                                    This is their chance to A: find a new planet for a mass exodus or B:
                                                    restart a colony on a far away destination. The first option is far
                                                    less grim. Coop takes the mission in the hopes of saving his kids,
                                                    but he knows the ramifications. Since time is all relative he does
                                                    not know when he is coming back. He does not even know what he will

                                                    outer reaches of the galaxy. The real adventure has begun. The
                                                    mission is clear. Save humanity from most certain extinction. It
                                                    does not make it easier however that messages are constantly being
                                                    relayed from earth. Coop and his three colleagues set up a plan of
                                                    action. Their first target is a water covered environment that looks
                                                    promising. Not so. Next, Coop overrules Brandt and they head to a
                                                    desolate world that a previous explorer had labeled as inhabitable.
                                                    To put it bluntly, he lied and he was not the only one.<br><br>Now

                                                    the crew of the Endurance. In one final act of selfless valor Coop
                                                    heads into a black hole and thus begins his own mind-blowing leg of

                                                    love and family. In the end, Coop spends a nice moment with his

                                                    space.” There are still scientific questions left to be debated for
                                                    years to come, but we know that love is one thing that is forever
                                                    true.<br><br>There are obviously numerous comparisons that can be

                                                    rather focus on the differences very briefly. In <span
                                                        id="director">Nolan</span>’s film, A.I. is actually useful and
                                                    more reliable and kind than humanity itself. It is Man who lies,
                                                    cheats and reverts to animalistic behavior all in the name of
                                                    survival. <span id="movie">Interstellar</span> has a lot of
                                                    scientific theory behind it (which I will acknowledge I do not know
                                                    the ins and outs of), however, it also has a very human component.
                                                    It is grounded on earth with Coop’s kids.<br><br>The visuals in
                                                    <span id="movie">Interstellar</span> are often breathtaking but we
                                                    would probably expect that for such an ambitious space saga. What I
                                                    really took out of this film was the score and juxtaposition of
                                                    sound. Hans Zimmer’s compositions were full of pounding organs that
                                                    somehow fit the mood with their majestic and still austere sound.
                                                    Furthermore, this film had a lot of dialogue and tense moments of
                                                    noise, however, when we are outside the spacecraft it is almost
                                                    completely silent reminding us of the reality of space. It is more
                                                    often than not a vast, silent unknown.<br><br>I am reminded of when
                                                    Coop explains to his daughter why she was named after <span
                                                        id="character">Murph</span>y’s Law which seems to be bad. He
                                                    replies that “<span id="character">Murph</span>y’s law doesn’t mean
                                                    that something bad will happen. It means that whatever can happen,
                                                    will happen.” And that was good enough for Coop and his late wife.
                                                    In some ways I think these words can be used to describe <span
                                                        id="movie">Interstellar</span>. With <span
                                                        id="director">Nolan</span>, there is the potential that whatever
                                                    can happen, will. There is excitement and magic in that, even if it
                                                    sometimes overshoots its bounds. It’s not necessarily a bad thing
                                                    and that’s good enough for me.<br><br>

                                                    process all this information. Because I have a lot of questions. Is
                                                    it possible that some things don't add up? Of course, big chunks
                                                    were left to our imagination. That way it always adds up. You might
                                                    not like the robots at first, but give them a chance. They are
                                                    awesome.

                                                    disadvantage about a science-fiction film is that they are mostly
                                                    based on a premise that defies common sense and may not even be
                                                    possible. Much like Modern Physics and the theories of relativity
                                                    that defy what we perceive as common sense. But it would be ignorant
                                                    to say that they aren't true and it would be ignorant to say that
                                                    <span id="movie">Interstellar</span> is complete
                                                    fiction.<br><br><br>If I were to be completely frank, I would say
                                                    <span id="movie">Interstellar</span> is pretty much another 2001: A
                                                    Space Odyssey without the mind melting finale it gives. It is a
                                                    captivating film with visual effects to kill for, a lot of which is
                                                    shot in IMAX, capturing beautifully the horror of the cosmos. Much
                                                    like 2001, it talks about man's place in the universe and makes a
                                                    solid statement at that towards the climax. It tries to juxtapose
                                                    emotional, scientific, rational and survival instincts, each of
                                                    equal significance and asks the characters to choose between them.
                                                    It looks like a pretty easy choice to the viewers but the film shows
                                                    how reality is far more different.<br><br>At a rudimentary level,
                                                    <span id="movie">Interstellar</span> is a lot of science but a lot
                                                    more of fiction. It addresses paradoxes of time and space but leaves
                                                    much to the 'magic' of a five dimensional world. So let's leave the
                                                    science to the explanations of the films in documentaries and talk
                                                    of it as just a film; and not just any film, n 'All Time Great'
                                                    film.<br><br>Look at Matthew McConaughey, the male protagonist <span
                                                        id="character">Cooper</span>, who pilots a spaceship carrying a
                                                    crew to a different galaxy via a wormhole created by some 'higher
                                                    beings' to search for a planet where the inhabitants of a dying
                                                    earth can survive and flourish. McConaughey is one actor who takes
                                                    his role seriously enough to give it his everything. Similar is
                                                    <span id="character">Cooper</span>'s character and so they tune in
                                                    nicely. Another notable performance comes from Michael Caine (but of
                                                    course) who plays Professor Brand, a physicist trying to device a
                                                    theory in order to make it possible for all the earth people to
                                                    reach the new planet. Caine, undoubtedly, looks intelligent enough
                                                    to pull this through. Anne Hathaway as <span

                                                    daughter has been given less work than she can actually take. A
                                                    particularly solid character is that of <span

                                                    amount of emotional mix into the story. All this coupled with time
                                                    dilation and black holes makes for one hell of a movie to
                                                    watch.<br><br>The best thing about <span
                                                        id="movie">Interstellar</span> is that it is intelligent and
                                                    silent at the same time. Of course when you incorporate actual
                                                    science in a movie, you throw in some exposition then and now into
                                                    the scenes but look at those serenic pauses that it provides you to
                                                    let the reality of the havocs inside the ship sink into the quiet of
                                                    the outer space. The movie even succeeds at finding reasonable
                                                    importance to the melodrama it throws at some points which I
                                                    initially hated but later pardoned; because the overall excitement
                                                    and thrill of the movie is awesome enough to complete it without any
                                                    higher morality or supernatural phenomenon or any brain frying
                                                    ending.
